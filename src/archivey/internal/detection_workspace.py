"""Detection-owned prefix workspace: one handle, one growing buffer, range views.

Every tier that reads from the front of a source does so through a
:class:`PrefixWorkspace`. Extending the window reads only the delta of the prefix;
bytes already in the buffer are not fetched again. :meth:`PrefixWorkspace.read_tail`
sits outside that buffer. It seeks to a fixed block at the end and restores the
handle, and it does not keep the bytes. A later tier that grows the prefix over
that range fetches them again. A seekable bzip2 or xz file larger than the prefix
does this: the trailer check runs when the near magic matches, and the inner-TAR
probe then reads the rest of the file. A file that already fits in the prefix has
the block in the buffer.

A seekable caller stream records its entry position and restores it on the way
out. The tail read adds one seek out and one seek back before that restore. A
non-seekable :class:`~archivey.internal.source.ArchiveSource` is peeked, so its
replay prefix holds the bytes and the backend reads them from the same object.

The access-shape rule and the seeks it allows: ``dev-docs/topics/detection.md`` §4.2.
