path, so a RAR opened from a ``BytesIO`` is copied to a temp file before ``unrar`` can

    A reader holds one budget for its lifetime, so the limit weighs every byte the
    reader copies, across attempts: a copy that failed part-way still counts. Call
    :meth:`check_total` with the size of everything about to be written when it is
    known, so an oversized source is refused before the first byte is written. Then
    copy each piece with :meth:`copy`, which stops before the written total crosses
    the limit even when a size was wrong or not known. The caller removes what it
    wrote when either one raises.

    Once the budget has refused, every later call refuses at once without writing.
    Without that, a source of unknown size would cost a full ``max_bytes`` write on
    each read that retried the copy.

    ``remedy`` is the refusal's last sentence: what the caller can do instead. The
    default fits a stream source, which a path would avoid copying.

    A write that has a fallback, and so must never refuse, asks :meth:`try_reserve`
    instead, and gives the charge back with :meth:`release` when it deletes what it
    wrote. A budget first made for such a write has no ``what`` yet; the first copy
    that can refuse names itself with :meth:`describe`, which must come before it.
