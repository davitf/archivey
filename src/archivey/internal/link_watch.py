"""Which destination paths each extracted symlink depends on, and rechecking on change.

A symlink is checked against the live tree when it is created, but a later member can
change what it resolves to. ``l -> a/../secret`` resolves inside the destination while
``a`` does not exist, because a ``..`` after a missing component is taken lexically.
Once a later member creates ``a -> .``, ``l`` resolves outside (threat model O22).

:class:`LinkWatch` records, for every link the extraction creates, the destination
paths its resolution looked at: every component the walk ``lstat``-ed, whether it
existed or not, including the components of every link the walk followed on the way.
Only the state of those paths decides where the link resolves. When a member changes
one of them, the coordinator calls :meth:`LinkWatch.recheck` before the next member is
handled, and the links that now escape are removed.

Only two kinds of change can move a resolution, so they are the only changes reported:

- a symlink appears at a path, and
- a symlink or a directory is removed or replaced. Removing a symlink turns the
  component back into a plain name, and removing a directory removes the links in it.

A regular file or a directory created where nothing was does not move a resolution:
``..`` after a missing component and after a plain one both go to the same parent.

The recorded set is closed under prefixes, as far as the link's own directory: every
path the walk visits is reached by appending one component to a path it visited
before, or to an ancestor of the link. So a change at ``d`` is enough to find every
link whose walk went through ``d/x``: it went through ``d`` too. A change to an
ancestor of the link itself needs no entry, because removing that ancestor removes
the link.

Paths are keyed by component, normalized to NFC and case-folded. On a case-sensitive
filesystem this can report a change for a link that did not depend on it; the recheck
then finds nothing, and costs one resolution. The opposite mistake would miss an escape
on a case-insensitive one.
