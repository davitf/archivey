# 7-Zip's ``-v`` writes ``name.7z.001``/``name.zip.001`` — in both cases a *raw byte
# split* of one finished archive, so the parts concatenate back into the original and
# one pattern serves both. An SFX module replaces the archive extension with ``.exe``
# (``7z a -sfx … -v`` → ``vol.exe.001`` … ``.00N``); the stub ``vol.exe`` has no
# ``.NNN`` suffix and is not a sibling. After detection misses, ``open_archive``
# follows that stub to the split first volume beside it (``first_volume_for_stub``).
# ``.sfx`` is not in this pattern: 7-Zip does not emit
# ``name.sfx.001``, and arbitrary ``name.foo.001`` is not a 7-Zip split. Info-ZIP's
# ``name.z01 … name.zip`` deliberately does not match this pattern: that is a true
# spanned set addressed by (disk, offset). A linear join of one lists correctly and
# then reads only whichever members happen to sit on the last disk, so it is refused
# in the ZIP backend instead. ``name.z01`` does match the broad old-scheme RAR shape
# below, and what keeps it out of a RAR set there is stated beside that pattern.
#
# **Three digits minimum, not ``\d+``.** 7-Zip numbers from ``.001`` and widens past
# part 999, so nothing it emits needs fewer. Accepting one or two would swallow
# ``name.zip.1`` / ``name.zip.2`` — what wget and naive rotation produce for two
# downloads of the *same* file — and concatenate two independent complete archives,
# handing back the wrong file's contents with no error. The completeness check cannot
# catch it either: ``[1, 2]`` is exactly ``1..N``. ``.exe`` is format-agnostic (7-Zip
# writes it for a 7z or ZIP payload), so this pattern is not kept in step with
# ``is_zip_split_segment_name`` (still ``zip\.\d{3,}`` / ``.zNN``). A lone
# numbered part (``.7z.001`` / ``.zip.001`` / ``.exe.001``) is refused at
# ``open_archive`` as an incomplete set, naming the missing parts — not as a ZIP
# spanned-set error. Info-ZIP ``.zNN`` stays that ZIP refusal.
#
# The part number is capped at 999 999 parts, which no real set comes near. The cap is
# on the value, not the width: leading zeros are matched outside the ``part`` group, so
# ``split -d -a 7`` output (``big.zip.0000001``) is still a set while ``a.zip.9999999``
# is not a part name. The captured group is at most six digits whatever the name, which
# keeps a part number read from a name small and keeps ``int()`` safe. A name from a
# directory listing is bounded by the filesystem's name limit, but a stream's ``name``
# and a path in an explicit sequence are checked before any file is opened, and Python
# refuses to parse an integer past ``sys.get_int_max_str_digits()`` digits (4300 by
# default) with a bare ``ValueError``. A larger number is not a part number, so the
# lone-part refusal below does not apply: a ``.7z`` or ``.exe`` name goes to ordinary
# detection, while a ``.zip`` name still matches the uncapped
# ``is_zip_split_segment_name`` and is refused as a spanned ZIP. The ``.partN`` pattern
# below has the same cap for the same reason.
# The largest part the six-digit ``part`` groups below can hold.

#
# The shape is deliberately broad. It also matches Info-ZIP's ``backup.z01`` and
# unrelated extensions such as ``cert.p12`` or ``image.e01``, so it only makes a name
# a candidate, and two guards in discovery decide. First, volume 1 (``<base>.rar`` /
# ``.exe`` / ``.sfx``) must sit beside the name: an Info-ZIP spanned set has none, so
# ``backup.z01`` is not a RAR volume and still reaches the ZIP backend's spanned-set
# refusal. Second, the walk of the names unrar would look for from volume 1 must reach
# the name, so ``notes.a01`` beside ``notes.rar`` is not a volume either. The cost of
# the breadth: opening a name of this shape pays one directory listing, where the fast
# reject in ``discover_volume_siblings`` turns other names away before any filesystem
# call. The explicit-sequence check classifies old-scheme parts with this same
# pattern, so it reads the base discovery groups on. It has neither guard, though, so
# there the breadth costs a false refusal: a stray of this shape (``readme.p12``,
# ``notes.e01``) in an explicit sequence counts as an old-scheme part, so beside parts
# of another scheme or another base the check refuses the sequence as two sets. No
# narrower pattern is sound. The name alone cannot tell ``beta.s00`` from

    are tried in can settle it: part 1 of the ``.partN`` set based on ``Show``, or
    volume 1 of the old-scheme set based on ``Show.part1``. Only the rest of the
    sequence knows — if ``Show.part1.r00`` is in it, the second reading is the one
    that makes the sequence a single archive, and it is the one
    :func:`discover_volume_siblings` produces from any of its continuation names. Not
    from ``Show.part1.rar`` itself: ``_RAR_PART_RE`` claims that name first there
    too, the grouping finds a single part number and discovery returns ``None``, so
    volume 1 of such a set is not an entry point. That gap is discovery's, not this
    function's, and closing it would change behaviour.

    For a single name, the patterns' trailing anchors keep ``my.part1.zip.001`` in
    the numbered scheme. This is a similar hazard one level up, where a name has to be
    read against the sequence around it rather than on its own.

    """Require the sequence to name the parts of one archive, as far as names can say.

    Parts of two different sets concatenate into bytes that are neither archive, and
    the numbering cannot tell you so: ``alpha.zip.001`` and ``beta.zip.002`` are a
    perfectly good ``1, 2``. Discovery already filters siblings by base, so this is
    the explicit path's equivalent — ``open_archive([…])`` with a caller's own
    ``sorted(glob("*.zip.*"))`` or ``sorted(glob("*.rar"))`` over a directory holding
    more than one set.

    Three things are checked, and the second and third exist because one alone leaves
    the caller above unprotected:

    1. Every name carrying a part marker must be in the same scheme. A base means
       something different in each — ``alpha.part1.rar``'s is the stem before
       ``.part``, ``alpha.zip.001``'s includes the archive extension — so comparing
       across them is meaningless, and a sequence populating two of them is two sets.
       One name reads two ways and is settled by the sequence rather than by itself:
       ``Show.part1.rar`` beside ``Show.part1.r00`` is that set's volume 1, not a
       ``.partN`` part — see :func:`_is_old_rar_first_volume_name_in`.
    2. Within that scheme the bases must agree, compared case-folded the way
       ``discover_volume_siblings`` groups siblings, so this never refuses a set
       discovery would have accepted.
    3. A name with no part marker that is nonetheless volume-shaped — ``<base>.rar``,
       or ``<base>.exe`` / ``.sfx`` for an SFX — is volume 1 of an old-scheme set and
       only belongs beside old-scheme parts (``.r00`` … ``.s00`` …) sharing its stem.
       Beside a ``.partN`` set it has no role at all, since that scheme spells its own
       volume 1 ``alpha.part1.rar``. Beside a numbered set only the executable
       spellings make sense, as the stub 7-Zip writes next to ``vol.exe.001``; a
       ``.rar`` there is a second archive. Without this the sequences the first two
       checks do catch are trivially reachable in the shapes they do not:
       ``[alpha.part1.rar, alpha.part2.rar, beta.rar]`` is one ``sorted(glob("*.rar"))``
       away.

    A name that is neither is passed over rather than ending the check — the globs
    above also return ``alpha.zip.bak`` and ``notes.zip.old``, and stopping at one
    would leave the parts around it unchecked depending only on where the stray
    sorted. A stray whose extension is one non-digit and two digits (``readme.p12``,
    ``notes.e01``) is not passed over: it has the old-scheme part shape, so beside
    parts of another scheme or another base, rule 1 or 2 refuses the sequence. That
    false refusal is the recorded cost of classifying old-scheme parts with
    discovery's own pattern (see the comment at ``_OLD_RAR_CONTINUATION_RE``).

    What this guarantees is still narrower than "the parts of one archive", and three
    residues stay.

    A sequence in which *no* name carries a part number is not checked at all, because
    nothing in it says any of those names is a volume: ``[alpha.rar, beta.rar]`` is two
    complete archives and joins. Rule 3 reads a bare ``<base>.rar`` against the marked
    parts around it, and with none there is nothing to read it against — refusing it
    instead would refuse a single-volume RAR passed as a one-element list, which is a
    documented way to call this.

    Parts with the same base in *different directories* join, which discovery could
    never produce but ``docs/opening-and-listing.md`` advertises this path for.

    And on a case-sensitive filesystem ``gamma.zip.001`` and ``GAMMA.zip.002`` are
    genuinely distinct files that the case-folding lets through.
