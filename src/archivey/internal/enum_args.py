"""Coercion for the public API's enum-typed arguments.

Every public entry point that declares an :class:`~enum.Enum` parameter accepts the
member's **value** spelled as a string, and converts it at the boundary. ``extract(dest,
overwrite="skip")`` is the same call as ``extract(dest,
overwrite=OverwritePolicy.SKIP)``, and an unrecognised spelling raises
:class:`~archivey.ArchiveyUsageError` there and then, naming what would have worked.

**Why coerce rather than refuse.** The CLI and a throwaway script both hold strings, and
the CLI was already doing this by hand (``ExtractionPolicy(policy)`` in
``cli/extract_cmd.py``) with its own dash-to-underscore fixup for ``AbortOn``. Doing it
in one place makes the library and the CLI accept the same vocabulary instead of two
that drift.

**Why it must happen at the boundary.** Before this module, an unrecognised value was
not refused, it was *ignored*: the consuming code tests ``policy is
ExtractionPolicy.TRUSTED`` and a string is never any member, so it silently took the
other branch. ``overwrite="skip"`` reached ``_apply_overwrite_policy``, matched neither
``ERROR`` nor ``SKIP``, and fell through to REPLACE — deleting the file the caller asked
to keep. ``on_error="stop"`` behaved as ``CONTINUE``. Converting at the entry point is
what makes those unreachable; a check that happens later, or not at all, is how they
happened.

**The cost, stated plainly.** Accepting a string makes the enum **values** public API.
``OverwritePolicy.SKIP.value`` cannot be renamed from ``"skip"`` afterwards without
breaking callers silently, in a way that renaming the *member* would not. The member
names are accepted too, for the same reason and with the same consequence. That is the
price of the CLI-friendliness this buys, and it is deliberate.

Spellings accepted for a member, all verified non-colliding by
``tests/test_enum_arguments.py``:

* its ``value`` (``"skip"``, ``"blocked_member"``, ``"auto"``)
* its member **name** (``"SKIP"``, ``"BLOCKED_MEMBER"``)
* either of those with any case, and with ``-`` and ``_`` used interchangeably — so the
  ``--abort-on blocked-member`` spelling from ``--help`` also works in a script

``format=`` is not an ``Enum`` (an :class:`~archivey.ArchiveFormat` is a ``(container,
stream)`` pair), so its own spellings live in :mod:`archivey.internal.format_args`.
