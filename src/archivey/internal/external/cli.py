"""Find and identify an external decompressor on ``PATH``, once per binary.

A program on ``PATH`` with the right name is not proof that it is the right program, so
each candidate runs once with an identification argv, and its banner decides. The
answer is cached by absolute path and stat identity, so later reads do not spawn the
probe again, and a binary replaced on disk is probed afresh.

This is the policy :func:`archivey.internal.backends.rar_unrar.find_rarlab_unrar`
applies to RARLAB ``unrar``, written once for any program. That finder shares
:func:`stat_identity` with this module, but it still runs its own loop and cache;
moving it onto :class:`CliToolFinder` is recorded in ``dev-docs/IDEAS.md``.

Once found, a program runs with its output on a pipe: :func:`spawn_for_stdout` starts
it, and a :class:`ProcessOutputStream` subclass owns it until close. Both the ``unrar``
and the ``unar`` read paths use them.

    ``<candidate> <probe_args>`` decoded as UTF-8 with replacement.

    Cache rules (the same as the ``unrar`` finder):

    - A durable answer is stored per absolute path with the binary's stat identity, so a
      lookalike costs one process per process lifetime, not one per member read.
    - A probe that runs out of time is stored as unusable. Re-probing would cost the
      full timeout on every read; the refusal names the binary and the timeout, so the
      cause stays visible. A replaced binary changes the stat identity and is probed
      again.
    - A ``which`` miss and a probe that could not *start* the binary (``OSError``) are
      not stored, so a program installed later is found without a restart.

    ``verify``, when given, runs once on a binary that identified and met the floor,
    and returns why the binary must not be used, or ``None``. Its answer is stored
    with the banner, under the same rules. An ``OSError`` it raises means the check
    could not run, which says nothing about the binary: it is not stored, and the
    refusal says the check could not run and includes the error.
