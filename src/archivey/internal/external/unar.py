"""Run ``unar`` (The Unarchiver's XADMaster command-line tool) for member bytes on stdout.

Format-agnostic. The caller names the archive by path and the entries by ``unar``'s own
entry indexes, in the order ``lsar`` lists them. This module does not decide which
archives ``unar`` reads correctly; a backend refuses those before it calls here
(see :mod:`archivey.internal.backends.rar_unar` for RAR).

The argv is fixed except for the archive path and the optional index list:

``unar -o - -q -nr -k skip [-p <password>] [-i] -- <absolute archive path> [index …]``

- ``-o -`` writes every selected entry to stdout, concatenated in archive order with no
  framing, and creates no file.
- ``-nr`` stops ``unar`` from opening an archive found inside the archive and emitting
  *its* contents instead (a ``.tar.gz`` member would otherwise come out as tar members).
- ``-k skip`` drops Mac OS resource forks, which would otherwise reach stdout as extra
  bytes after the data fork.
- ``-i`` makes every trailing argument an entry index; without it, every entry is
  selected. Indexes are decimal numbers built
  here, so a hostile entry name never reaches the argv; there is no include mask to
  match siblings, and no glob to backtrack on.
- ``--`` ends option parsing and the archive path is absolute, so a path that starts
  with ``-`` cannot read as an option.

A password goes on the command line as ``-p <password>``, the only way ``unar``
accepts one. **Other local users can read it** from the process list (``ps``,
``/proc/<pid>/cmdline``) while ``unar`` runs; the public docs say so. ``unar`` answers a
wrong password with exit 0 and no output, so :class:`UnarOutputStream` can map an empty
pipe to ``EncryptionError`` when the caller says the entry is encrypted. Measured on
1.10.1: a password that is not ASCII does not decrypt (RAR5), whatever the locale, so
:func:`unar_password_supported` rejects one before ``unar`` runs.

A ``unar`` that identifies itself is also checked once for what it does: it must decode
an 85-byte RAR5 archive (:data:`_RAR5_PROBE_ARCHIVE`) whose one member the Debian and
Ubuntu ``unar`` packages that carry ``CSInputBuffer-bit-string-reading.patch`` write
as nothing, with exit 0. Those builds lose about one compressed RAR5 member in 25, and
no version string tells them apart from a good build, so one that fails the check is
not used (:func:`unar_rar5_probe_failure`). ``dev-docs/known-issues.md`` has the
measurements.
