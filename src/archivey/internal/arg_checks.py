"""Type validation for the public arguments that carry an object, not an enum.

This module holds the reusable half of the object-argument refusals. The rest live
beside their arguments:

* :mod:`archivey.internal.format_args` — ``format=``, which *coerces* rather than
  only refusing: ``format="zip"`` resolves to ``ArchiveFormat.ZIP``, and only an
  unrecognised value is an ``ArchiveyUsageError``.
* :mod:`archivey.config` — ``ArchiveyConfig``'s own fields, and the ``__post_init__``
  of each ``*Limits`` dataclass (``DetectionBudget`` in
  :mod:`archivey.detection_cost` too), which call :func:`check_limit_fields` here
* :mod:`archivey.internal.selection` — ``members=``
* :mod:`archivey.internal.password` — ``password=``
* :meth:`archivey.reader.ArchiveReader.open` — the member argument (needs the
  reader to tell "wrong type" from "not this reader's member")

What this module covers: ``config=``, ``limits=``, ``encoding=``, ``extract_all``'s
``dest``, the ``on_progress=`` / ``filter=`` callbacks, the numeric limit fields, the
empty string as a path, and the ``source`` refusals (``require_source``,
``reject_source``, ``raise_if_text_stream``, ``raise_if_write_only_stream``). There is
no useful conversion from a wrong one of these, so the answer is an error.

Every check answers with :class:`~archivey.ArchiveyUsageError`, which sits outside
``ArchiveyError`` (ADR 0012) so a caller's ``except ArchiveyError`` cannot swallow a
caller bug. The class raised is one of its two private subclasses, so the error is also
a ``TypeError`` (wrong type) or a ``ValueError`` (a right type whose value is refused:
a ``str`` that names no usable codec, a negative or non-finite limit, an empty path),
as DR-15 asks.

What this module is for is narrower than "validate everything". The error contract
already permits a short list of raw exceptions to reach a caller — ``KeyError`` for
an unknown member name, ``TypeError`` for ``len()``/``in``, ``io.UnsupportedOperation``
for an unsupported ``seek``, ``ValueError`` for I/O on a closed stream, and ``OSError``
unchanged. Those stay. What does not is an exception that crosses the boundary
**naming a private attribute of ours**: ``'str' object has no attribute
'diagnostic_policy'`` tells the caller who passed ``config="strict"`` nothing about
what they did wrong, and leaks an internal field name while failing to. That is the
"no internal leakage" rule in ``CONTRIBUTING.md``, and it is the shape every check
here exists to close.

The checks run at the **entry point**, not at the point of use. On ``config=`` that is
a message-quality choice; on ``limits=`` and the ``*Limits`` field types it is load
bearing, because the attribute those arguments are missing is not read until the
listing or the extraction is already under way.
