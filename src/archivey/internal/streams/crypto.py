"""AES decrypt stage via the ``[recommended]`` extra (``cryptography`` package).

Format parsers must not import ``cryptography`` directly — only this module does
(the backend stays swappable). AES is a *pipeline stage* ahead of a decompressor
(e.g. AES → LZMA2 for an encrypted 7z folder).

Layers here:

- :class:`DecryptStage` / :func:`open_aes_decrypt_stage` — feed ciphertext chunks,
  get plaintext (used when composing inside a larger open).
- :class:`AesDecryptStream` / :func:`open_aes_decrypt_stream` — pull ``BinaryIO``
  wrapper over a ciphertext source (7z member data: CBC, optional seek).
  RAR headers and WinZip AES keep their own pull streams; see the class
  docstring.

Key derivation is not here: each format derives its keys its own way, so the 7z KDF
and its coder-property parser live in :mod:`archivey.internal.backends.sevenzip_aes`,
beside RAR's in ``rar_parser`` and WinZip AES's in ``zip_aes``.

    """Pull ``BinaryIO`` that decrypts an underlying ciphertext stream via AES-CBC.

    This is the 7z member-data wrapper. CBC can restart at any block using the
    preceding ciphertext block as the IV, so when the ciphertext source is
    seekable this stream is too — that is what keeps ``seekable_members=True``
    on an encrypted 7z folder. ``tell`` is the **plaintext** offset.
    ``seekable()`` follows the ciphertext source. ``SEEK_END`` still needs a
    known ciphertext length (production ``SharedView`` / ``SlicingStream``
    expose ``.size``); an unsized seekable source raises
    ``io.UnsupportedOperation``. Mid-stream ``seek`` still works.

    Two AES-CBC pull streams share :class:`DecryptStage`.
    ``WinZipAesDecryptStream`` is CTR and builds its own cipher; it shares
    only the availability check.

    Folding ``_HeaderDecryptStream`` in is blocked by the header walk, not by
    flags this class is missing:

    - ``tell()`` is archive offset for both arms. ``header_fd`` is either the
      raw handle or the decrypt stream; a second method does not help while
      the raw handle is the other arm.
    - The stream sits mid-file on the shared archive handle, unbounded.
      Without a ``length=`` bound it would treat the rest of the file as
      ciphertext and report seekable; seeking would reposition the archive.

    Ownership is ``owns_inner`` (both borrow). ``read`` already gathers short
    source reads. A short last ciphertext block raises ``TruncatedError``
    (the private ``_AesCbcTruncatedError`` subclass). ``size`` / ``SEEK_END``
    report the intact full-block length, so the two truncated lengths
    answer differently after ``SEEK_END``:

    - 53 ciphertext bytes: ``size`` is 48, ``SEEK_END`` lands at 48, a
      subsequent read is empty (cursor already at recoverable EOF).
    - 5 ciphertext bytes: ``size`` is 0, ``SEEK_END`` at origin is a
      no-op (``new_pos == _pos`` before the past-end branch), and the
      next read raises. Marking eof whenever ``new_pos >= size`` would
      silence that sub-block case.

    After a completing read raises, the intact prefix stays in ``_buf``
    and ``_eof`` stays false: catch and drain the buffered blocks. Only
    a read that reaches the truncated tail raises. This is this class's
    policy: ``_HeaderDecryptStream`` never calls ``finalize``, and
    WinZip AES does not use ``DecryptStage``.
