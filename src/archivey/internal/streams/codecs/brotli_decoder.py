    The ``brotli`` import is local because it's an optional dependency with no type stubs;
    ``BrotliCodec.open`` in the codec layer gates on its presence before constructing this, so
    the import here always succeeds.

    Brotli ≥1.2.0 exposes ``process(..., output_buffer_limit=)`` and
    ``can_accept_more_data()`` (CVE-2025-6176 mitigation). The limit is block-granular
    (observed floor ~32 KiB), not a hard byte cap, but it stops a single ``process``
    from materializing multi-megabyte bombs on ``read(1)``.

    **Finding the end.** ``brotli`` says nothing about where a stream ends: a call whose
    input runs past the end fails outright ("decoder failed"), loses that call's output,
    and leaves the decompressor unusable. The same failure is what corrupt data gives, so
    the decoder cannot tell the two apart from the error. It finds out by replaying:
    a fresh decompressor is brought to the last point where everything handed over had
    been decoded and delivered (``_settled``), by decoding the source from the start with
    the output discarded, and the input from there to the failure is then handed over one
    byte at a time. If the stream finishes on one of those bytes, what follows is trailing
    data and the output lost with the failed call is delivered; if not, the original
    error was corruption and is raised. The replay reads the source again, so it needs a
    seekable one; on a pipe the failure stays a ``CorruptionError``. It costs one more
    decode up to the failure, paid only by a file with bytes after its stream or a corrupt
    one.
