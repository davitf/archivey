"""Resume a DEFLATE decode with ``zlib`` at a block boundary another decoder found.

rapidgzip's index lists DEFLATE block boundaries: a compressed *bit* offset and the
decompressed offset there. At a block boundary an inflater carries only two things
forward: where it is in the input, and the last 32 KiB of output (back-references
reach no further; Huffman tables are per block). Given both, ``zlib`` can start there:

- the output before the point goes in as a preset dictionary, which is what a raw
  DEFLATE ``decompressobj(-15, zdict=...)`` fills its window with;
- the bit offset is the hard part. zlib's ``inflatePrime`` would feed the leftover
  bits, and Python's ``zlib`` does not expose it. So the input starts with empty
  DEFLATE blocks, made up here, whose length in bits ends ``bit`` bits into a byte.
  That byte's other bits are the source's own, and every byte after it is the source
  unchanged, so the decode lines up with the source again from there.

zlib only checks a stream's checksum (gzip CRC-32, zlib Adler-32) over the whole
stream, and a resumed decode never saw the part before its point. So a resumed decode
that reaches the end of its DEFLATE stream raises :class:`ResumeReachedStreamEnd`, and
the caller decodes from the start instead, which checks it. Reaching the end of the
input first is a truncation, which a checksum would not change.

:class:`DeflateResumeDecoder` serves ``_StdlibOnAcceleratorError`` in
``codecs/stdlib_takeover.py``, which takes over a read from rapidgzip. :func:`stream_end`
asks only whether a raw DEFLATE stream reaches a final block, and where. Raw DEFLATE has
no checksum, so there reaching the end is the answer, with no ``ResumeReachedStreamEnd``
case. Its caller is ``_DeflateEndCheckStream`` in ``codecs/zlib_codec.py``, before any
takeover, to decide whether one is needed. The points for both come from
``RapidgzipChildStream.resume_point``.
