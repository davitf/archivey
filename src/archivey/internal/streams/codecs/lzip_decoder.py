"""Seekable lzip decoder for :class:`~.decompressor_stream.DecompressorStream`.

Opened via :class:`~.codecs.LzipCodec` / ``open_codec_stream(Codec.LZIP, …)``.
Pure-stdlib over Python's ``lzma`` module.

lzip format (per the lzip manual): a file is a sequence of one or more *members* that may
be concatenated freely. Each member carries its own sizes in a 20-byte trailer (the
"distributed index"), enabling random access without a separate index.

  Per member:
    Header  (6 bytes):  magic b"LZIP"(4) + version(1; only 1 is read, see below) +
                        coded_dict(1; dict_size = 1 << (coded_dict & 0x1F), exp 12-29)
    LZMA1 data:         raw LZMA1 with an end-of-stream marker, fixed lc=3,lp=0,pb=2.
                        The 13-byte LZMA_ALONE header is absent and synthesised here.
    Trailer (20 bytes): crc32(4 LE) + data_size(8 LE) + member_size(8 LE)

Version 0 (lzip before 1.0, with a 12-byte trailer and no member size) and any later
version are refused with :class:`UnsupportedFeatureError` by the forward decoder, and
by the backward index walk at each member header it reaches. A full ``LZIP`` magic
always starts a member, so a version-0 member after a version-1 one is refused too,
not read past as trailing data, as ``lzip`` itself reports "Version 0 member format
not supported" for it. The walk cannot reach a real version-0 member strictly
between two version-1 members; it fails as corrupt there, the seek index degrades,
and the forward decoder refuses the member (:func:`_iter_trailers_backwards`).

    :data:`TRAILING_DATA_SEARCH` bytes, whose member size leads back to a member
    header. A member size is below the file size, so its high bytes are zero, and it is
    not zero, so one of its bytes is not: a trailer ends at most 7 bytes past the

    trailing data on both paths. A member there whose version is not 1 is refused as
