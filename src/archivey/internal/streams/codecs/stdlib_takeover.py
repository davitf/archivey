class _StdlibOnAcceleratorError(DelegatingStream):
    """Finish a rapidgzip decode with the standard library when rapidgzip fails on data.

    The DEFLATE family (rapidgzip in a child process) and bzip2 (rapidgzip's bzip2
    decoder, in this process) both use it; the defaults below are the DEFLATE family's,
    and the bzip2 differences are at the end.

    rapidgzip decodes ahead in chunks and raises as soon as one fails, without handing
    over the output of the chunks before it: measured on rapidgzip 0.16, a 40 MB gzip
    with twelve bytes appended raised after 37.7 MB of 40 had been delivered. It raises
    the same errors for bytes after the last member as for damage ("Failed to parse
    gzip/zlib header", "Decoding failed"), so the error cannot say which it met. The
    standard-library decoder can: it reads to the end of the data and reports what
    follows it, or raises at the damage with the error type it always uses.

    So on a data error this stream switches to the standard-library decoder, over a
    fresh view of the source, skips the bytes already delivered, and carries on. That
    costs a second decode up to that point (from a resume point, below), paid only by a
    file with something after its data or a damaged one. An error from the caller's own
    source is not a data error and passes through unchanged. A seek decodes too, and a
    data error there switches the same way: rapidgzip's error does not say whether it
    met damage or bytes after the data, such as the NUL padding ``gzip -t`` accepts,
    and the standard library's seek does.

    ``limit``, the size a container declared, switches the same way when a read would
    take the output past it. For raw DEFLATE, rapidgzip decodes on past the stream's
    final block, into a second stream, where zlib stops. Output past the declared size
    is either that or a stream too long for both decoders, and the standard library
    decides which, from the position before that read. Up to the end of the first
    stream the two decoders agree, so a caller sees what the standard library gives.
    Only the raw DEFLATE path sets ``limit``, even where gzip and zlib have a declared
    size: their streams end where the standard library ends them, so the
    ``VerifyingStream`` alone checks the size there.

    A ZIP member sets ``limit`` from its ``expected_decompressed_size``, so its stream
    is wrapped by ``_wrap_accelerated_length``, whose ``VerifyingStream`` has the same
    size as its ``expected_size`` and bounds each of its reads to what remains of it.
    There the only read that reaches past ``limit`` is that verifier's one-byte
    over-run probe at the declared size (``_probe_past_declared``): this branch is
    what decides an over-run on the accelerated path. A 7z coder is the other case.
    It declares an unpack size but no ``expected_decompressed_size``, so
    ``_wrap_accelerated_length`` adds no verifier: ``limit`` is the coder's unpack
    size alone, and any read can cross it. A valid coder's last read ends exactly at
    that size, so it does not switch. In both cases a switch decodes the stream again
    with the standard library from its start, up to the position already delivered.

    A truncated stream is the case where the second decode matters most, and where
    starting it over is most wasteful. rapidgzip 0.16 aborts the child on one, and its
    threads decode ahead of the reader, so the reader can be megabytes short of the cut
    when the child dies (with every core decoding, a cut file of tens of MB can deliver
    nothing). A child crash (``crashed_on_data``) and a truncation rapidgzip reports
    switch here too, and the standard library starts at the child's ``resume_point``: a
    DEFLATE block boundary the reader passed, with the 32 KiB of output before it
    (``deflate_resume``). That bounds the second decode by rapidgzip's read-ahead, the
    spacing of the index queries (``_query_after`` in ``rapidgzip_child.py``) and the
    spacing of the points, rather than by the file. Every data error starts there:
    damage after the point raises from the resumed decode as it would from a full one,
    and a resumed decode that reaches the end of its DEFLATE stream (appended bytes, or
    damage only a checksum shows) cannot check the stream's checksum, so it raises
    ``ResumeReachedStreamEnd`` and the standard library decodes from the start after all
    (``_restart_without_resume``). The two other switches (``limit`` and
    ``switch_to_stdlib``) start from the start, because neither has a resume point to
    use: ``limit`` takes the over-run verdict from the position before the read, and
    the callers of ``switch_to_stdlib`` know no DEFLATE block boundary. The gzip ISIZE
    check and the zlib Adler-32 check on a cut stream know only the position delivered;
    the zlib check at the end of the first of two zlib streams knows a position behind
    it (the end of that stream, passed as ``position``), which is not a block boundary
    of the decode either.

    For bzip2, ``takes_over`` names the bzip2 decoder's data errors (it raises an opaque
    ``RuntimeError('std::exception')`` on a cut stream, where the standard library
    raises ``TruncatedError``), and ``resume_points`` gives the blocks it had indexed
    before the error (``_bzip2_resume_points``; a block needs no window, see
    ``bzip2_resume``).

    Once switched, a data error of the standard library leaves as the codec's typed
    error (``translate``), as it does from the outer translator with the accelerator
    off. A raw ``zlib.error`` would be taken for the accelerator's opaque end-of-input
    error by the over-run probe of a declared size (``_probe_past_declared``), which
    reads it as "no more data": a ZIP member declared empty with a body that is not
    DEFLATE read as empty, where the accelerator off raises. Only the DEFLATE family
    passes ``translate``: bzip2's accelerated path adds no ``_wrap_accelerated_length``
    verifier, so no over-run probe sits inside it, and its translator maps every
    ``ValueError`` to ``TruncatedError``, which inside the stream would claim a usage
    error (a closed source) that ``ArchiveStream`` reports as one.

    ``empty_to_stdlib`` hands a stream that ends before its first byte to the standard
    library, which decodes a valid empty stream to nothing as well and raises on a cut
    one. rapidgzip ends a raw DEFLATE stream cut before any output softly (``03``, a
    final block with no end code, reads as empty). The second decode costs nothing that
    matters: the stream produced no output.
