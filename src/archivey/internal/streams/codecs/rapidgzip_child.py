"""Run rapidgzip's decoders (DEFLATE family and bzip2) in a child process.

rapidgzip 0.16 aborts the whole process when it decodes a gzip, zlib or raw DEFLATE
stream that ends early: a destructor in its chunk decoder throws (``BitReader::tell``,
"The bit buffer should not contain more data than have been read from the file!") and
``std::terminate`` runs. That happens for a path, a file object and an in-memory
buffer alike, and no Python ``try/except`` can catch it. In a child process the abort
costs the member, and the caller gets an archivey error.

:class:`RapidgzipChildStream` is the seekable decompressed stream the codec layer
wraps, as it wrapped rapidgzip's own reader in-process. The child runs
``rapidgzip_worker.py`` as a script, which imports nothing from ``archivey``; the
protocol is in that file's docstring. A path source is opened by the child. A stream
source stays in this process: the child asks for each read, seek and tell, and this
process answers from the caller's stream, so an exception from that stream reaches
the caller unchanged.

Measured cost (``scripts/bench_rapidgzip_child.py``, one Linux machine): about 25 ms to
start the child and import rapidgzip, and about 70 µs per round trip. A full read took
1.1 to 1.35 times as long as in-process rapidgzip, and stayed about 1.5 times faster
than the stdlib engine.

rapidgzip's bzip2 decoder (``IndexedBzip2File``) runs in the same kind of child, one
per stream (``bzip2=True``), as a precaution: it has not been seen to abort, but it
comes from the same library as the DEFLATE decoder, which does. Being native code is
not by itself a reason to isolate a decoder (the standard library's are not);
an observed crash that cannot always be avoided is. ``scripts/accelerator_crash_search.py``
keeps looking for crashes in both, by running them on damaged input in a process it
watches, so whether the isolation is still needed stays known.
