    - ``filters`` — the ``lzma`` raw filter chain (required for raw LZMA1/LZMA2; this is
      where Delta/BCJ stages and the coder properties enter).
    - ``properties`` — raw coder properties blob (e.g. 7z PPMd var.H parameters).
    - ``ppmd_order`` / ``ppmd_mem_size`` / ``ppmd_restore_method`` — ZIP method-98 PPMd8
      parameters (mutually exclusive with 7z ``properties`` for :class:`PpmdCodec`).
    - ``unpack_size`` — known uncompressed output length (7z folder unpack size). Passed
      to PPMd as ``max_length`` so PPMd7 cannot overshoot without an end mark. Raw
      LZMA1/LZMA2 stop reading at it; pass it only for a stream that may have no end
      marker (ZIP LZMA with bit 1 clear, a 7z LZMA1 chain), since it also hides output
      past that size. An end marker found right at it is still checked. Raw
      DEFLATE under rapidgzip hands over to zlib at it, when the container sets no
      ``StreamConfig.expected_decompressed_size`` (a 7z coder).
    - ``pack_size`` — known compressed length for the PPMd coder input (7z pack stream /
      ZIP compressed size / sized view). Raw LZMA reads no input past it, so a 7z AES
      pad after it is not input after the end marker. Must match the bytes passed to
      ``PpmdDecoder.feed`` (not an enclosing member size). Gates post-eof empty
      drains; when omitted, PPMd recovery stays conservative (single capped NUL only).
    - ``single_stream`` — the coder's data is one stream of its codec: a bzip2 ZIP
      member or 7z coder, a Zstd ZIP member. The decoder ends at the first stream's
      end rather than reading a further stream (a Zstd frame) as a concatenated
      file's, so a further stream is input after the end, which a
      ``refuse_input_after_end`` stream refuses. Under the bzip2 accelerator, which
      reads on into a further stream, the read hands over to the standard library
      where one starts (``bzip2_codec._Bzip2Layout``). A 7z Zstd or LZ4 coder does
      not set it: there concatenated frames count together against the unpack size.
      Raw LZMA1/LZMA2 needs no flag: it is container-only and always ends at its first
      end marker, refusing any input after it.
