        block (a ``.pyc``, a font, 1.2 % of random data over 64 KiB) passes the walk and
        the window decode, which never reaches the compressed block; a real decoder then
        fails within a few hundred bytes of its header. Decoding ``[0, end)`` is mostly a
        copy of the uncompressed bytes, and a sequential read.

        either keeps decoding or runs out of input, and both are accepted.

        The charge comes before the read because the read is what the budget bounds: on
        a seekable source ``read_at`` has no ceiling of its own. The detector's
        ``read_at`` serves any ``[0, end)`` its ``charge_decode`` accepted, so a granted
        charge is always spent on a decode.
