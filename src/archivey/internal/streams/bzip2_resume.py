"""Resume a bzip2 decode with ``bz2`` at a block boundary another decoder found.

rapidgzip's bzip2 index lists where each block starts: a compressed *bit* offset and
the decompressed offset there. A bzip2 block carries no state from the blocks before
it (each is a separate Burrows-Wheeler transform with its own Huffman tables and CRC),
so a decoder can start at any block. Two things stand in the way of ``bz2``:

- it reads a stream, not a block, so the input must start with a stream header. The
  header made up here is ``BZh9``. The digit is the largest block size the decoder
  accepts, and it changes nothing else in the output, so it fits a block from a stream
  of any level, including the second stream of a concatenated file;
- a block starts at any bit, and ``bz2`` reads whole bytes. So the input is shifted
  left by the block's bit offset into its first byte, a chunk at a time, with the last
  byte of each chunk carried into the next. Its bits are then where ``bz2`` expects
  them, right after the made-up header.

The stream's combined CRC, in its end-of-stream marker, covers every block's CRC, and a
resumed decode never saw the blocks before its point. So when it reaches the marker the
check fails, and ``bz2`` says "Invalid data stream", exactly as it does for a damaged
block. The resumed decode cannot tell the two apart, and does not try: on that error, or
on a clean end, it raises :class:`ResumeReachedStreamEnd`, and the caller decodes from
the start instead, which decides. Reaching the end of the input first is a truncation,
and the stdlib's own :class:`~archivey.exceptions.TruncatedError` is the verdict.

The caller is ``_StdlibOnAcceleratorError`` in ``codecs/stdlib_takeover.py``, which
takes over a read from rapidgzip's bzip2 decoder; the points come from
``_bzip2_resume_points`` there.
