"""BCJ2 decoder: 7-Zip's four-stream x86 branch converter (7z method ``0x0303011B``).

The encoder splits an executable into four streams, stored as four separate 7z pack
streams:

- **main**: every byte of the output except the 4-byte targets it moved out;
- **call**: big-endian absolute targets of converted ``E8`` (CALL rel32);
- **jump**: big-endian absolute targets of converted ``E9`` (JMP rel32) and ``0F 8x``
  (Jcc rel32);
- **rc**: one range-coded bit per branch candidate: was this one converted?

Decoding copies ``main`` up to and including the next candidate opcode, decodes one
bit, and on a 1 takes a target from ``call`` or ``jump``, turns it back into a
relative one (``target - (position + 4)``) and emits it little-endian. The bit's
probability model has 258 contexts: one per preceding byte for ``E8``, one for ``E9``,
one for ``Jcc``. The range coder is LZMA's (11-bit probabilities, 5 move bits, a
5-byte start). Its five start bytes are read with the first output byte, so an empty
output reads no ``rc`` byte at all. That is
7-Zip 9.20's ``Bcj2_Decode`` (``C/Bcj2.c``); later 7-Zip restructured the code, not the
format.

Where the time goes. The Python loop runs once per *candidate* (``E8``, ``E9``,
``0F 8x``), not per byte; real x86 code has one every 30 bytes or so, and a hostile
``main`` made of nothing else is the worst case. Two choices keep that loop cheap,
both measured on 7-Zip ``-mx9`` archives of ``git`` and ``python3.11`` (CPython 3.11):

- Candidates are found with two ``bytes.find`` calls over a translated copy of the
  block (``_MARK`` folds ``E9`` onto ``E8`` and ``80``-``8F`` onto ``80``), which run at
  memchr speed. A regex character class (``[\\xe8\\xe9]|\\x0f[\\x80-\\x8f]``) finds the
  same positions but scans byte by byte in ``re``'s engine, and on ``git`` that scan
  alone cost as much as the rest of the loop.
- ``call`` and ``jump`` are unpacked a block at a time into ints (``_Targets``), so a
  converted branch costs one iterator step. Slicing four bytes and calling
  ``int.from_bytes`` for each target was three times slower per target.

Together they doubled the stage's speed (about 13 to 26 MB/s on ``git``, 17 to 33 MB/s
on ``python3.11``) without changing what the decoder refuses.
