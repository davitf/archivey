"""Seek-point plumbing shared by the decompressing streams.

``ask_resume_offset`` is the rewind-cost query used by
``ArchiveStream._maybe_warn_rewind``. This is an archivey concept — seek-point tables
on decompressing streams. Implementations:

- own a table — ``DecompressorStream``, ``_AcceleratorStream``
- preserve that offset space — ``ArchiveStream``, ``OutputCountingStream``,
  ``VerifyingStream``, ``_GzipTruncationCheckStream``
- translate the offset space — ``AesDecryptStream`` (ciphertext to plaintext),
  ``SlicingStream`` (contiguous window; ``SharedView`` inherits it)

``DelegatingStream`` does not grow it.

The duck-typing helper itself is generic ``getattr`` plumbing, so it lives in
:mod:`archivey.internal.streams.streamtools.binaryio` and this module
re-exports it as the archivey-facing name.

:class:`ResumeReachedStreamEnd` is the signal both mid-stream resume decoders
(``deflate_resume`` and ``bzip2_resume``) raise when they cannot give a verdict.

    The plain query reads each seek-point table as it stands, so a diagnostic never

    itself would act on: a ``DecompressorStream`` builds its index on a forward seek
    (an lzip or xz trailer read) and may then jump. While this call runs, such a
    stream builds that index first (:func:`planning_seek`). The flag rides a context
    variable, so the wrappers that forward the query need no change.

    Returns the resume point and the first report that index build escalated, if
    any. The report belongs to the seek being planned, so the caller raises it once
    that seek has moved, as the stream's own seek would have (or drops it with the
    plan). Nothing is left on the stream for an unrelated later call to raise.
