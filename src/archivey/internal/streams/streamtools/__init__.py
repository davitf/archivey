"""Generic binary-stream plumbing — adapt, classify, and slice arbitrary ``BinaryIO``.

This subpackage is the codec- and format-agnostic core of the stream layer: it knows
nothing about archivey's error hierarchy or any codec, only about stdlib binary streams.
That independence is deliberate — it could be lifted out as a standalone library — so
nothing here may import from the rest of ``archivey``. The import rule is the half
tooling enforces; concept leaks count too. Do not put archivey types, the error
hierarchy, or codec internals in the *API* of this package (call-site examples in
"when to use" comments can stay).

Named exception: ``SlicingStream.nearest_resume_offset`` translates a
contiguous window into the inner's offset space, and ``ask_resume_offset`` in
``binaryio`` is the duck-typing helper it uses. That is generic offset
arithmetic, not the seek-point table — the table stays outside this package.
The method name is archivey-specific; this may move later if the package is
lifted out.

Module map:

- :mod:`.base` — ``ReadOnlyIOStream`` / ``DelegatingStream`` (wrapper bases)
- :mod:`.binaryio` — classify/coerce sources (``is_seekable``, ``ensure_binaryio``, …)
  plus ``ask_resume_offset`` (duck-typed resume query; see the named exception above)
- :mod:`.slice` — ``SlicingStream`` / ``SharedView`` bound views + ``fix_stream_start_position``
- :mod:`.shared` — ``SharedSource`` (concurrent independent views over one handle)
- :mod:`.locked` — ``LockedStream`` / ``CloseLockedStream`` (whole-op lock wrappers)
- :mod:`.solid` — ``SolidBlockReader`` (forward-only solid demux)

When to use which concurrency helper:

- ``LockedStream`` — one shared handle; hold a lock across each seek+read (TAR/ISO).
- ``SharedSource`` + ``SharedView`` — each consumer has its own logical
  position; every read re-seeks under the lock (ZIP-style shared file).
- ``SolidBlockReader`` — one forward decode; hand out consecutive member slices
  (7z folder / RAR pipe). Not seekable.

Import from this package root rather than the individual modules.
