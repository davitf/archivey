"""Demultiplex one forward-only decoded stream into consecutive member sub-streams.

A *solid block* — a 7z folder, or a RAR ``unrar p`` pipe — decodes to a single
forward-only (often non-seekable) byte stream whose members occupy consecutive,
known-size ranges. :class:`SolidBlockReader` owns that stream and hands out one member
sub-stream at a time, skipping forward **lazily**: the gap before a member is consumed
only when the *next* member is opened, so closing a never-advanced member costs nothing.
Closing the reader closes the block without draining.

Not the same as :class:`~archivey.internal.streams.streamtools.shared.SharedSource`
(independent seekable views) or :class:`~archivey.internal.streams.streamtools.locked.LockedStream`
(lock around seek+read on one handle). This class is deliberately forward-only.

``open_member(..., lazy=True)`` defers open/skip until the first read — so an
iterator that yields then closes an unselected member pays nothing.

Like the rest of ``streamtools``, truncated blocks surface as plain :class:`EOFError`
for the caller to translate.

The closed / superseded / same-offset guards on :class:`_MemberSlice` are
defence-in-depth for this primitive's own contract. Current backends serialize
member access via ``_drive_pass_streams(close_previous=True)``, so no public
``open_archive`` path holds two live slices at once.
