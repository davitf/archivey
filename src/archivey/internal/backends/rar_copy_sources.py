"""Keep the bytes a solid RAR pass decodes for the file copies that follow them.

A RAR5 file copy (``rar -oi``) has no data of its own; it reads as its source member.
``unrar p`` and ``unar`` emit nothing for it, so a solid pass used to serve each copy
from a named open of the source, and every such open decodes the solid stream again
from its start up to the source. Fifty copies of a 1 KiB file behind 100 MiB of solid
data decoded 5 GiB.

:class:`FileCopySources` sits between the pass's decompressor output and its
:class:`~archivey.internal.streams.streamtools.solid.SolidBlockReader` and keeps the
bytes of every member a later copy reads, as the pipe passes them, whether or not
the caller reads that member. Small sources stay in memory; a larger one goes to a
temporary file charged to the reader's spool budget (``SpoolLimits.max_bytes``). The
file is opened, and the source charged, only when the source's first byte arrives,
and :meth:`FileCopySources.close` gives the charge back. A source that fits neither
is not kept, and its copies fall back to the named open.
Kept bytes are served unverified; the caller wraps them in the source's digest
check, as it does the pipe's own bytes.
