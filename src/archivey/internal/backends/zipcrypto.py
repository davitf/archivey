    only on the low 16 bits of ``t``, so a 64 KiB table indexed by ``k2 & 0xFFFF``
    replaces the multiply.

    Bits 0 and 1 of ``k2`` do not matter either. ``| 2`` forces bit 1 on. Bit 0 only
    picks which neighbour ``t ^ 1`` is: with bit 0 clear the product is ``t * (t + 1)``,
    with it set it is ``(t - 1) * t``, the same pair. So every group of four
    consecutive indices ``4j .. 4j + 3`` shares the value computed at ``t = 4j + 2``.

        * The keystream byte is a lookup in :func:`_keystream_table` instead of a
          multiply.
        * ``k0`` is held split, as ``k0_low`` (its low byte) and ``k0_high`` (the upper
          24 bits). The CRC step ``k0 = (k0 >> 8) ^ crc[(k0 ^ c) & 0xFF]`` becomes a
          byte update and a 24-bit update with pre-split table halves, and ``k1``
          reads ``k0 & 0xFF`` as ``k0_low`` directly, with no mask or recombining.
          ``k0`` is reassembled once, at the end.
        * The ``k2`` index ``(k2 ^ (k1 >> 24)) & 0xFF`` becomes
          ``(k2 & 0xFF) ^ (k1 >> 24)``, masking ``k2`` alone.

        The dropped masks rely on two widths. ``k1`` is masked to 32 bits every step,
        so ``k1 >> 24`` is already a byte and the ``k2`` index needs no outer mask.
        CRC table entries are at most 32 bits, so ``k0`` and ``k2`` stay 32-bit
        through ``(x >> 8) ^ entry`` and ``k0_high`` stays 24-bit, which is why the
        reassembly needs no mask either. Removing the ``k1`` mask would break both.
