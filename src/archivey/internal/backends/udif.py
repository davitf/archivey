"""UDIF disk images (``.dmg``): recognise the ``koly`` block, and refuse the image.

A compressed image stores its blocks as ordinary zlib, bzip2 or xz streams. The
first of those is a real stream, so a prefix read extracts one block and calls
the rest of the image trailing data. The image itself is the 512-byte ``koly``
block: at offset 0 on an old image, or at the end on every image the backup
scan found. Reading the blocks is a separate feature. This module exists so
detection can name the image and ``open_archive`` can refuse it.
