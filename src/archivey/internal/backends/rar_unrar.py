    ``version_control`` adds ``-ver`` so the pipe includes WinRAR file-version history
    payloads (needed for solid demux when versioned FILE rows are present, and for a
    named open of a ``path;n`` history member — the ``-n`` mask excludes history rows
    unless ``-ver`` is set).

    A named ``member`` is passed as a ``-n./`` include mask, never positionally, so a
    hostile member name cannot inject an ``unrar`` switch or ``@listfile`` argument
    (see :func:`_member_include_switch`). It is ``bytes`` for a name given to
    ``unrar`` as stored (:func:`unrar_member_argument`). The child runs under a
    UTF-8 locale (:func:`_unrar_env`).

    When a non-empty ``password`` is given, the switch is bare ``-p`` and the password
    (plus a trailing newline) is written to the child's stdin — ``unrar`` reads it from
    stdin when redirected, keeping the secret out of ``argv``. A password containing a
    line break or a NUL is refused rather than sent, because ``unrar`` would read only
    the part before it, and a longer one is cut to the 127 UTF-16 units RAR hashes —
    see :func:`_password_stdin_bytes`. That bound is what lets the whole password be
    written before stdout is read: it always fits in the pipe buffer, so the write
    cannot block on a child that is itself blocked writing a full stdout.

    Reading ``stdout`` has no time bound. A read waits for as long as the child
    takes to produce bytes, and nothing here stops a child that stalls. A solid
    archive can legitimately produce no bytes for a long time while ``unrar``
    decodes the members before the target, so an idle timeout would refuse valid
    work. The only timeouts in this module are the version probe and the teardown
    in :func:`~archivey.internal.external.cli.terminate_process`.
