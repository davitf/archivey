    password and a header CRC can prove it right; here the limit is ``unrar``'s stdin,
    not the password, so it is an ``UnsupportedFeatureError``.

    ``unrar`` reads the password as a single line that ends at the first newline or
    NUL, and discards the rest. Measured against RARLAB ``rar`` 7.00: an archive
    whose password is ``ab`` decrypts when ``"ab\\nXX"`` is supplied, and a RAR4
    member whose password is ``password`` decrypts with ``"password\\x00zz"``.
    That is a wrong password accepted, and nothing downstream can tell. The native
    header path (:func:`rar_parser._rar3_s2k` / :func:`~rar_parser._rar5_s2k`)

    it the same way, which is one byte for one byte.

    A hostile archive can name a member like a switch (``-inul``) or an ``@listfile``
    argument; passed positionally those are mis-parsed by ``unrar`` (a switch, or a
    read of an attacker-chosen local file). Passing the name as the value of the ``-n``

    not a switch (it is inside ``-n``) and the leading ``@`` is not a listfile (the
    value starts with ``.``). For a name **without** wildcards, ``./`` also anchors
    the mask to the exact archive path rather than matching the basename at any
    depth.

    ``unrar`` masks treat ``*`` and ``?`` as wildcards with no escape (``[]`` are
    literal, ``\\`` does not escape). A name whose globs are confined to the
    basename and that contains no backslash is still passed as a mask, via
    :func:`_unrar_mask_for`, which narrows ``*`` to ``?``. Any mask can select
    more than its own member (a duplicate name, a glob, a name ``unrar`` cuts
    short), so ``RarReader._open_member`` skips the others using the parsed
    member list and :func:`unrar_mask_selects`. A glob in a directory component,

    RAR5 name that is not valid UTF-8 is cut at its first bad byte, and a RAR3
    Unicode name keeps the code unit its writer truncated. A trailing separator is
    dropped, since a mask ending in one selects whole directories.

    ``unrar`` turns a mask from argv into characters with the same conversion it

    argv is Unicode, not bytes, so there the view (the OEM reading of the bytes,

    ``None`` means there is no mask to give; :func:`unrar_member_refusal` turns
    that into a reason. Backslashes are separators in RAR3's stored bytes and
    ``/`` in the mask; the bytes follow the name.

    ``surrogates_as_wildcards`` is for a RAR 1.5-4 Unicode name. Its view holds
    UTF-16 code units. On POSIX the mask goes out as UTF-8 bytes, and ``unrar``'s
    ``mbstowcs`` rejects a surrogate's UTF-8 form, so each unit becomes ``?``, which
    matches exactly one unit. The mask can then select other members too, which the
    reader handles like any glob's siblings. Windows argv is UTF-16 and carries a

    ``version_control`` adds ``-ver`` so the pipe includes WinRAR file-version history
    payloads (needed for solid demux when versioned FILE rows are present, and for a
    named open of a ``path;n`` history member — the ``-n`` mask excludes history rows
    unless ``-ver`` is set).

    A named ``member`` is passed as a ``-n./`` include mask, never positionally, so a
    hostile member name cannot inject an ``unrar`` switch or ``@listfile`` argument
    (see :func:`_member_include_switch`). It is ``bytes`` for a name given to
    ``unrar`` as stored (:func:`unrar_member_argument`). The child runs under a
    UTF-8 locale (:func:`_unrar_env`).

    When a non-empty ``password`` is given, the switch is bare ``-p`` and the password
    (plus a trailing newline) is written to the child's stdin — ``unrar`` reads it from
    stdin when redirected, keeping the secret out of ``argv``. A password containing a
    line break or a NUL is refused rather than sent, because ``unrar`` would read only
    the part before it, and a longer one is cut to the 127 UTF-16 units RAR hashes —
    see :func:`_password_stdin_bytes`, which also needs ``rar5`` (true for a RAR5
    archive) to tell a wrong password from one ``unrar``'s stdin cannot carry; the
    default gives the refusal, which claims nothing about the password. That bound is what lets the whole password be
    written before stdout is read: it always fits in the pipe buffer, so the write
    cannot block on a child that is itself blocked writing a full stdout.

    Reading ``stdout`` has no time bound. A read waits for as long as the child
    takes to produce bytes, and nothing here stops a child that stalls. A solid
    archive can legitimately produce no bytes for a long time while ``unrar``
    decodes the members before the target, so an idle timeout would refuse valid
    work. The only timeouts in this module are the version probe and the teardown
    in :func:`~archivey.internal.external.cli.terminate_process`.

    Returns ``(proc, stdout)``. Caller must terminate/wait/close.
