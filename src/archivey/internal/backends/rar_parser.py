"""Native RAR metadata parser (RAR 1.5 / 2.x / 3.x through RAR5).

Parses archive headers into :class:`RarArchive` / :class:`RarMemberInfo` without
decompressing member data and without importing ``rarfile``. Header encryption uses
:mod:`archivey.internal.streams.crypto` (never ``cryptography`` directly).

On-disk layout this module walks::

    [ optional SFX stub ][ magic ]
        RAR 1.5–3.x:  b"Rar!\\x1a\\x07\\x00"      → RarArchive.version == 4
        RAR5:         b"Rar!\\x1a\\x07\\x01\\x00"  → RarArchive.version == 5
    [ block sequence … until ENDARC ]
        RAR3 family: MARK / MAIN / FILE / … / ENDARC
          each: CRC16 | type | flags | header_size | [body] | [packed add_size]
        RAR5: vint-framed MAIN / FILE / SERVICE / ENCRYPTION / ENDARC
          optional encryption block before encrypted headers
          optional MAIN locator extra → QO SERVICE (FILE header copies after the members)
    FILE rows point at packed bytes after the header (``data_offset``).
    When a stored unencrypted QO is reachable from the locator, listing parses
    those copies, seeks back to after MAIN, and walks. A FILE whose offset is
    in QO is emitted from the copy and skipped (consecutive cached spans chain
    in memory, then one seek). ``CMT`` after MAIN is a normal SERVICE on that
    walk. FILE after QO is kept.

``RarArchive.version`` uses **4 for the whole RAR3-on-disk family** (1.5/2.x/3.x) and
**5 for RAR5** — not "RAR 4.x product version". Multi-volume sets are merged by
:func:`parse_rar_volumes` (split sizes/CRC; offsets rebased for
:class:`~archivey.internal.volumes.ConcatenatedFile`). Member **payload** decode is
``unrar`` via :mod:`.rar_unrar` / :mod:`.rar_reader`.

    """Decrypt one encrypted RAR header with AES-CBC.

    Each encrypted header is its own CBC message: RAR3 prefixes an 8-byte salt,
    RAR5 a 16-byte IV, then ciphertext padded to 16-byte blocks. ``read`` returns
    plaintext; leftover bytes in ``_buf`` are the unread tail of the last
    decrypted block. Mid-header, that tail is still-owed plaintext. After the
    walk has consumed ``header_size``, it is AES padding — not bytes this header
    still owes. Either way ``tell`` is the ciphertext cursor (see below).

    ``tell`` is the underlying **ciphertext** cursor, including unread leftover.
    After a full header read, ``data_offset`` needs that position so the next
    salt/IV (or packed data) starts on a block boundary. Subtracting
    ``len(_buf)`` would report the logical plaintext offset and land inside the
    padding; the next header then decrypts as garbage.

    There is no ``seek``. CBC *can* reposition (``AesDecryptStream`` restarts
    from the preceding ciphertext block as IV), but the parser never needs it:
    after the header is consumed this wrapper is discarded and packed-data
    skips go through ``source``. ``tell`` is the ciphertext cursor rather than
    a plaintext offset. Do not prefetch plaintext and rewind — that is why
    :func:`_read_rar5_block` reads the size vint byte-at-a-time.

    Not :class:`~archivey.internal.streams.crypto.AesDecryptStream`. That 7z
    wrapper has ``owns_inner`` (both streams borrow) and a plaintext
    ``tell``/``seek``. What still blocks folding this class in is the header
    walk: ``header_fd`` is either the raw handle or this stream, and
    ``tell()`` means archive offset for both arms; and this wrapper sits
    mid-file unbounded, so a seeking decrypt stream would reposition the
    shared archive handle. The decrypt *stage* is shared; the pull stream is
    not.

    ``read`` rejects unbounded ``n < 0``. It has no per-read size cap: the
    caller already bounds the ask. RAR5 refuses ``hdrlen > _RAR5_MAX_HEADER``
    (2 MiB) before the body ``read_exact``; RAR3 ``header_size`` is a 16-bit
    field (max 65 535). A tighter 8 KiB cap here used to reject a well-formed

    """SHA-1 plus the WinRAR 3.x KDF buffer-mutation bug.

    WinRAR's SHA-1 runs the message schedule in place on its 64-byte block
    buffer, then writes the expanded words back little-endian. ``hashlib.sha1``
    does not mutate its input, so the digest of *this* ``update`` is correct —
    and then, when ``data`` is a ``bytearray`` containing a complete SHA-1 block
    at a block boundary (``dpos`` skips the already-absorbed prefix), this class
    applies the same in-place corruption so the *next* ``update`` of a reused
    seed matches WinRAR.

    RAR3 string-to-key hashes the same ``password + salt`` seed 0x4000×16
    times. Mutation is not "the first time the seed crosses 64 bytes": it
    fires only when this ``update`` contains a complete SHA-1 block at a
    hasher block boundary (``dpos + 64 <= len(data)``). A 65-byte seed never
    satisfies that, even though ``len(data) > 64``; a 128-byte seed does on
    the first call. Seed ≤ 64 bytes (including the 8-byte salt) never enters
    ``_corrupt``. Ported from ``rarfile`` 4.3 ``Rar3Sha1``; there is no

    RAR5's cost is the archive's choice: ``2**kdf_count`` PBKDF2 rounds, accepted up
    to ``2**24`` (about 3-4 s each). RAR3's is a fixed 2**18-round SHA-1 loop that
    runs in Python. RARLAB writes one salt per archiving run, so every volume of a
    header-encrypted set repeats the same derivation; without a cache each volume
    paid it again.

    The caches are built in ``__init__``, not with ``@functools.cache`` on a method:
    that one cache would live on the class, keyed on ``self``, and keep every reader,
    password and key alive until the process exits. ``RarReader`` holds one instance
    for its lifetime and passes it to every parse and member-side derivation, so the
    keys go when the reader does. :func:`parse_rar_archive` and
    :func:`parse_rar_volumes` run without a reader, which is why the cache is an
    object passed in; they make a fresh one per call when none is.

    The methods only normalize the password before the cache lookup: the reader
    passes ``bytes`` on the header walk and ``str`` on member reads, and both must
    hit one entry. Keyed by the normalized password, the salt and (RAR5) the round
    count, so a wrong candidate never answers for a right one and the three RAR5
    outputs (AES key, HashKey, PswCheck at ``+0``/``+16``/``+32`` rounds) stay
    distinct.

    The caches have no size bound, and need none: an entry is added only on a miss,
    and a miss runs the derivation the caller was about to run anyway, at the
    archive's declared cost. Entries cannot grow faster than the CPU work that
    produces them, so an archive that varies its salts gains no amplification over
    the per-derivation cost it already had. Two threads racing on one entry may both
    derive it, which costs time but never a wrong key. Neither this class nor the
    cache wrappers has a ``repr`` that shows passwords or keys.

    Each miss is charged to ``budget``
    (:attr:`~archivey.config.DecoderLimits.max_key_derivation_rounds`) before it
    runs: RAR5 at its PBKDF2 round count, RAR3 at its fixed ``2**18``. The charge
    sits inside the cached function, which ``functools.cache`` calls only on a miss,
    so a hit costs nothing. Without a budget the cache charges one built from the
    default limits.

    RAR 2.9-4 store a file name as two fields separated by a NUL: an 8-bit name
    in the local/OEM charset, then a compressed UTF-16 name. The compressed form
    is a *delta against the 8-bit name*, which is why both are needed: they are
    position-aligned, character i of the Unicode name against byte i of the
    8-bit one, so ``pos`` indexes the output and ``std_name`` at the same time.

    ``encdata[0]`` is the high UTF-16 byte shared by most of the name. The rest
    is a stream of 2-bit opcodes, four per flags byte, MSB first:

      0  next byte is a low byte, high byte 0        (ASCII / Latin-1)
      1  next byte is a low byte, high byte ``hi``
      2  next two bytes are the low and high bytes   (anything else)
      3  run: the next k characters equal the 8-bit name's, optionally shifted
         by a correction byte. k is 2..129, so one opcode byte can emit 129
         code units.

    Bounded by construction: a t=0/1/2 unit costs an encoding byte and a run
    unit costs a ``std_name`` byte, so the output cannot exceed
    ``len(std_name) + len(encdata)``. (``encdata[0]`` is ``hi`` and any output
    needs a flags byte, so the live length is strictly less; there is no
    runtime cap because it cannot fire.) Overrunning either field means the
    name is corrupt: return None and let the caller fall back to the 8-bit
    field.

    Without that stop, an empty 8-bit field plus RLE-heavy ``encdata`` spent
    ~11 s of CPU at the ``uint16`` ``name_size`` ceiling (~6.7e6 code units,
    13.5 MB, discarded before any member existed). The memory was always
