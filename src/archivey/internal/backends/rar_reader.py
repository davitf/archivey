"""Native RAR reader backend.

Module split:

- :mod:`.rar_parser` — metadata, offsets, encryption headers, multi-volume merge
- :mod:`.rar_unrar` — spawn RARLAB ``unrar p`` (password on stdin; ``-n./member``)
- :mod:`.rar_unar` — the refusals and pipe layout when the caller selects ``unar``
  (``ArchiveyConfig.rar_decompressor``); the process itself is
  :mod:`archivey.internal.external.unar`
- this module — ``BaseArchiveReader``: list from the parser; member **data** via unrar,
  or via ``unar`` when selected (same shapes, entries named by index instead of mask)

Data-open shapes:

- Solid archive → one ``unrar p`` ALL-pipe + :class:`SolidBlockReader` demux
- Stored, unencrypted, every part found → direct sliced view (no ``unrar``),
  whatever the solid flag; a split member's part views are joined
- ``RarDecompressor.NONE`` → only that direct view; every other read is refused
- Other non-solid → per-member named ``unrar p -n./…`` opens
- Stream / non-path sources may be materialized to a temp ``.rar`` so ``unrar``
  can open a real path (and resolve sibling volumes)

WinRAR ``-ver`` history members are presented as ``path;n`` (see
:func:`_presented_filename`). Passwords feed three places: header parse, ``unrar``,
and RAR5 ConvertHashToMAC when checksums are tweaked.

    Measured with ``unrar`` 7.00 (``dev-docs/formats/rar.md`` §7). ``unrar`` sizes a
    nonsolid member's window to the smaller of its declared dictionary and its
    unpacked size, and the pages fill only as output is written. A 64 KiB member
    that declares 4 GiB stays near 8 MiB resident. In a solid archive the window
    only grows: ``unrar`` keeps the largest dictionary declared by any member it
    has decoded. It decodes every earlier member, across solid streams too. A
    member that starts a new stream still paid about 300 MiB for the 1 GiB window
    and 300 MB of data ahead of it. So the count for a solid member is the smaller
    of the largest dictionary declared up to and including it and the unpacked
    bytes of those members.

    The unpacked size is a header value, as the dictionary is. When it is too
    small, the reader's own size check stops reading at that size, and ``unrar``
    then blocks on the full pipe. So the bytes written, and so the pages touched,
    stay near the declared size. A stored member, a directory and a redirect use
    no dictionary (:func:`uses_no_dictionary`) and add nothing to the window or
    to the decoded bytes. In a nonsolid archive they count 0. In a solid one they
    count the window built ahead of them, because ``unrar`` decodes every earlier
    member to reach them: measured, a stored 64 KiB member behind a 300 MB member
    declaring 1 GiB took 314 MiB resident. The walk keys on the archive's MAIN
    solid flag, as ``unrar`` does: with it set and the member's own solid flag
    clear, the read still took 314 MiB; with it clear and the member's flag set,
    ``unrar`` decoded nothing ahead (47 MiB, the parent's own). ``rar -s`` writes
    both flags on every member after the first. The reader slices a stored member
    itself whatever its solid flag, unless it is encrypted or its encryption is
    unsettled: such a member reaches ``unrar`` by name and is charged its entry

    read. When *we* terminate the process (early close / teardown) the return code
    is negative and no error is raised. A signal that ends ``unrar`` after it closed
    its output came from elsewhere (or was a crash), and maps to
    ``ResourceLimitError`` / ``ReadError`` (:func:`signal_exit_error`), never to a

    distinguishes a per-member open (``-n`` mask) — where "no files matched" (code 10)

    is not an error.

    ``has_verifiable_hash`` suppresses the corruption/no-match mapping (codes 2/3/10):
    when the member carries a CRC32/BLAKE2sp that archivey verifies itself, that check
    is authoritative, and some legacy archives (e.g. RAR 1.5) make ``unrar`` report a
    spurious CRC error (exit 3) while emitting correct, verified data. A wrong-password
    exit (11) always maps — it means no usable data regardless of any stored hash.

    RAR4 often reports exit 3 (CRC) instead of 11 for a missing/wrong password, with
    empty stdout. After verify's short-before-digest preference that would otherwise
    surface only as ``TruncatedError`` (0 of N) while ``has_verifiable_hash`` suppresses
    the CRC exit. When the member is encrypted and we read zero plaintext bytes, map
    exit 2/3 to ``EncryptionError``.

    Exit mapping runs on the **empty/completing read** when the process has already
    exited (ADR 0014 eager-finalize parity), so ``archive.read()`` / a completing
    ``read()`` see ``EncryptionError`` on the read path rather than only from
    ``close()``. ``close()`` still maps if the empty-read path never ran (early stop).

    read with ``pos > size`` is empty, and a read at ``pos == size`` still
    reaches the pipe so fused verify's one-byte overrun probe can see trailing
    output — that boundary read is clamped to one byte.

    ``_pos`` is the logical offset. ``_pipe_pos`` is pipe progress clamped to

        survived the damage fails against the bytes, and hand them back unverified
        when none survived. Archivey applies the same digest test and refuses the
        second case, which is the maintainer's ruling (see ``format-rar``).

        Which digest survives is the writer's choice, not ours: RAR5 keeps CRC32 in
        the fixed FILE header and BLAKE2sp in the extra area, so a cut area destroys
        one and leaves the other. A surviving digest is a real discriminator because
        an encrypted member's stored digests are key-tweaked (``ConvertHashToMAC``)
        whenever the writer sets that flag, and are the *plaintext* digest when it
        does not — ciphertext matches neither.

        The check runs **before** any byte is handed back, like the ZIP ZipCrypto
        stored path (``_open_stored_confirmed``): both face a member whose framing
        cannot reject wrong bytes incrementally, and a caller that stops reading
        early would otherwise never reach the end-of-stream verdict. The extra pass
        costs one read of an already-damaged member and never touches the happy path.
