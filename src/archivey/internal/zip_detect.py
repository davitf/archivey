"""Cheap ZIP local-header identity check for the SFX scan.

Four bytes of ``PK\\x03\\x04`` in a stub are not a ZIP. The cued scan calls
:func:`validate_zip_local_header` with a candidate-relative view; EOCD plus
central-directory confirmation is the tail probe's job, not this check.

Also: :func:`is_zip_split_segment_name` — Info-ZIP ``.zNN`` and 7-Zip
``name.zip.NNN`` split naming. A name matching it is refused in ``open_archive``
before format detection (middle/last parts typically have no magic at offset 0),
*unless* the whole set was found on disk and joined — see
``internal/volumes.py``, which concatenates 7-Zip's byte slices back into the
ordinary ZIP they came from. Info-ZIP's spanned sets are never joined.
