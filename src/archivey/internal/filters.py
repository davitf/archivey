"""Universal path-safety checks and policy permission transforms for extraction.

Two independent stages sit in front of every on-disk write (see ``safe-extraction``):

* :func:`check_universal` — the non-bypassable path/link/special-file constraints,
  enforced under **every** :class:`ExtractionPolicy` (including ``TRUSTED``). Run on the
  **final** member, after the policy transform and the caller's filter, so a filter can
  rename an unsafe member to a safe one; whatever it returns is checked.
* :func:`reroot_absolute` — under ``STANDARD`` and ``TRUSTED``, an absolute name is
  moved inside the destination by dropping its root, as tar, unzip and 7-Zip do.
  ``STRICT`` does not re-root, so ``check_universal`` refuses the member there.
* the policy transforms in :data:`POLICY_TRANSFORMS` — permission/ownership normalization
  applied to a transient copy of the member, selected by the active policy.

The post-``os.symlink`` re-resolution check (the third defense-in-depth layer) lives in
the coordinator, next to the ``os.symlink`` call it guards.

    - each surrogateescape char ``U+DC80``–``U+DCFF`` (a raw byte 0x80–0xFF that did
      not decode as UTF-8), as the byte;
    - each character Windows refuses in a name, ``<>"|?*`` and the controls
      0x01–0x1F, as its code point (``a?b`` → ``a%3Fb``). POSIX could write them, but
      then the same archive gives a different tree on Windows.

    In a name that has either, a literal ``%`` becomes ``%25``, so a *rewritten* name
    unescapes back to its bytes.

    Only names that actually carry such characters are rewritten — valid Unicode
    (including NFC/NFD forms) is representable on every filesystem and is returned
    unchanged; its cross-platform folding is the collision-tracking concern, not a
    representability one.

    A lone surrogate outside U+DC80-U+DCFF (a 7z name can keep one) is not a byte,
    and this function leaves it alone. ``apply_name_policy`` first spells it as its
    UTF-8 bytes, so it arrives here as three of them and ``hi\\ud800`` is written
    ``hi%ED%A0%80`` on every OS. ``TRUSTED`` skips both steps and writes 7-Zip's bytes
    (``disk_spelling``).

    The escaping is therefore reversible within a rewritten name, not across names: a
    stored ``%FF`` is returned verbatim and a raw ``0xFF`` byte is also written ``%FF``.
    The name alone cannot tell the two apart; ``ExtractionResult.presented_name`` can:
    after this rewrite it differs from the written name in the escaped bytes. A set
    ``presented_name`` alone is not enough, since an absolute-name re-root sets it too,
    and then it differs from the written name only by the root it lost. The collision
    map sees both spellings as one key, so the second is resolved by the
