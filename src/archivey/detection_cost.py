"""Detection budget and cost receipt.

Detection's I/O happens before a reader exists, so its measured work is a sibling of
:class:`~archivey.cost.CostReceipt` rather than part of it. The two share vocabulary for
kinds of work; they are never summed together. See the ``detection-cost`` and
``access-mode-and-cost`` capability specs.

**Public, not re-exported.** Callers reach :class:`DetectionBudget`, its presets and
:class:`DetectionBudgetPreset` here, as ``archivey.detection_cost.…``, to set
:attr:`ArchiveyConfig.detection_budget <archivey.ArchiveyConfig.detection_budget>`.
The receipt and skip types are what :attr:`FormatInfo.cost_receipt
<archivey.FormatInfo.cost_receipt>` is made of. All of them are documented on the API
page and stable under the same rule as ``archivey.terminal``; the mutable accumulator
detectors write into lives under ``internal/``.

    probes, their completion check and the inner-TAR probe. ``max_decode_output`` bounds
    the inner-TAR probe only; a content probe's output is bounded by the codec's own
    drain (4 KiB, or 64 KiB with the whole source in hand) and is not charged.

    against in full (see ``format-detection``); ``0`` turns the check off.
