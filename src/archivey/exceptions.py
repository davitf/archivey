"""Archivey exception hierarchy.

Two roots (intentional):

- :class:`ArchiveyError` — archive / environment / format problems. Safe to catch
  broadly when wrapping untrusted input.
- :class:`ArchiveyUsageError` — caller API misuse. Deliberately **outside** the
  ``ArchiveyError`` tree so ``except ArchiveyError`` does not hide bugs in calling
  code.

Under ``ArchiveyError`` the groups follow the cause, not the call that hit it:
:class:`OpenError` means reading never started, :class:`ReadError` means the archive's
data is bad or unreadable (a damaged header at open included), and
:class:`ExtractionError` means writing a member to disk failed; beside them sit the
feature, package, resource-limit and diagnostic errors.

A type earns a place here only when a caller would act on it differently from its
parent. Anything finer goes in the message.

Both roots **escape their message** at construction: the text call sites build
interpolates attacker-controlled member names and the paths derived from them, and
an exception message reaches a terminal by routes no single consumer configures —
including a traceback the interpreter prints on its own. See
:class:`ArchiveyError` for what stays raw and why.

Every exception in both trees survives ``pickle``, ``copy`` and ``deepcopy`` with its
``args``, message and attributes intact, so an error raised in a worker process reaches
the parent whole. As with any Python exception, ``__cause__`` and ``__context__`` are not
carried across a pickle.

class ArchiveyError(Exception):
    """Root of all Archivey exceptions.

    **The message is escaped.** Call sites build messages by interpolating
    archive-derived text — a member name, or a destination path built from one — and
    those are attacker-controlled. An exception message reaches a terminal by more
    routes than any one consumer controls: ``print(e)``, ``logging.exception``, a
    third-party error reporter, and above all an uncaught exception whose traceback
    the interpreter prints itself, whose final line is ``str(e)``. Escaping in the
    handler that displays it protects only the routes someone remembered to
    configure; escaping here protects all of them, with no configuration.

    So ``message`` is stored escaped, and that escaped form is what
    :meth:`__str__`, ``args[0]`` and ``repr()`` all render. ``raw_message`` keeps the
    text as the call site wrote it, for the one job the escaped form cannot do: being
    embedded in *another* message that will escape it in turn.

    ``archive_name``, ``member_name``, ``link_target`` and ``source_format`` stay
    **raw** too, for callers that need the real value to act on rather than to print.
    :meth:`__str__` renders the names through ``!r``, which escapes them for display in
    turn — so a name available as an attribute should **not** also be interpolated into
    the message, or it prints twice. Prefer prose plus attributes:
    ``FilterRejectionError("Symlink target escapes destination", member_name=name,
    link_target=target)``.

    ``format_unconfirmed`` is a boolean (default ``False``): ``True`` when the format
    claim rested only on a content probe with nothing corroborating it (no matching
    extension, no inner-TAR upgrade), or only on the file extension because every
    content signal declined, so a decode failure should not be read as "this known
    format truncated." Confidence is irrelevant to the flag.

    **Escape exactly once, at the outermost message.** Everything a message
    interpolates should therefore be raw when it goes in — which is what the two
    helpers are for, and why neither of them is a matter of taste:

    - a member name, link target or path → :func:`~archivey.terminal.quoted`, not
      ``!r``. ``!r`` escapes first, and this escapes the backslashes it introduced.
    - a caught exception that might be one of ours → :func:`raw_message_of`, not
      ``{exc}`` or ``{exc!r}``.

    Note this is the opposite of the rule for ``logger.*`` calls, whose records the CLI
    does **not** escape: there, ``%r`` is what makes an interpolated name inert and must
    stay.
