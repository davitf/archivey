# Target tree, nav, and the rule that keeps it

Companion to [`inventory.md`](inventory.md). **Q1 and Q2 are decided** — the site
unpublishes maintainer material *including* the raw ADR log; curious-user depth
lives on one published page ([`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) D1/D2). Q3–Q9 still
affect individual pages, marked where they do.

## The decision rule

The brief proposes two axes and four quadrants. Testing it against the real tree,
it holds — with one clarification (agent tooling is not documentation). The earlier
"ADR log stays published" refinement was reversed (D2, 2026-08-02): adoption
"why"s are summarised on `how-it-works.md`; raw ADRs are maintainer provenance.

| | **Current / normative** | **Historical / evidence** |
|---|---|---|
| **User** | `docs/` — the published site | `CHANGELOG.md` |
| **Maintainer** | `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `VISION`/`PLAN`/`IDEAS`, `openspec/specs/`, `dev-docs/` (live registers + runbooks + **ADR log**) | `dev-docs/investigations/`, `dev-docs/history/`, `review/archive/`, `openspec/changes/archive/` |

**The invariant that makes it enforceable:**

> Everything under `docs/` is published and is for users.
> Nothing else under `docs/` exists.

That is a one-line CI check (`every docs/**/*.md appears in mkdocs.yml nav`) with
no exception list. The alternative — keeping maintainer material under `docs/` and
excluding it via `exclude_docs` — needs a second list that must stay in sync with
the first, which is precisely the drift that produced six published-but-unlisted
pages. The cheaper `exclude_docs` alternative was weighed and rejected in Q1.
Raw ADRs follow the same rule: they move to `dev-docs/decisions/`, they are not
left under `docs/` and excluded.

**Clarification — `.claude/` and `.cursor/` are configuration.** They are Markdown
addressed by tools at literal paths. Filing them as "contributor docs" invites a
move that breaks the tools.

## Where a new doc goes

Four questions, in order. The first `yes` wins.

1. **Would someone who only *uses* the library need it?** → `docs/`, and add it to
   the nav in the same commit. (Curated "why we chose X" one-liners for curious
   users belong on `how-it-works.md`, not as a new page per decision.)
2. **Is it a load-bearing "why" that is decided and won't change?** → a new ADR in
   `dev-docs/decisions/` (keep it ADR-shaped: Context / Decision / Consequences,
   tens of lines). If it needs an `## Open questions` section, it is not an ADR
   yet. Mirror a one-line outcome onto `how-it-works.md` when the choice is
   user-relevant.
3. **Does a contributor need it to work on the code *today*?** → `dev-docs/` (live
   register or runbook).
4. **Is it finished evidence — an investigation, a superseded design, a lab
   notebook?** → `dev-docs/investigations/` (or `dev-docs/history/` for prose that
   a newer document replaced).

If it is a *review*, it belongs to the `review/` lifecycle. If it is a *proposed
behaviour change*, it belongs to `openspec/changes/`. Neither is affected by this
review.

### And the linking rule that goes with it (D3)

A published page **must not link into unpublished docs**. In order:

1. **Prefer no link.** If a published page needs a fact, the fact belongs on a
   published page — a link into maintainer material usually means it is filed in
   the wrong place. For ADR citations specifically: inline the end-user one-liner
   and drop the link (D2), unless the ADR still has uninlinable user-relevant depth.
2. **If the extra context is genuinely worth keeping**, link the file on GitHub:
   `https://github.com/davitf/archivey/blob/main/dev-docs/<file>.md` — the pattern
   `README.md:20-22` already uses.
3. **Never** a bare repo path in prose standing in for a link.

Nine internal/grab-bag links exist today; [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) D3
resolves each one. Ten ADR links are resolved under D2.

## Proposed nav

Ordered by what a reader needs first, which is also the order the independent
code-derived pass argued for. `Gotchas` stays immediately after basic usage as
`openspec/specs/documentation/spec.md:86` requires.

```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Install and extras: install.md
  - Reading archives: reading.md
  - Gotchas: gotchas.md
  - Safe extraction: safe-extraction.md
  - Access costs and pitfalls: access-and-cost.md
  - Formats and extras: formats.md
  - Errors and diagnostics: errors-and-diagnostics.md
  - Command line: cli.md
  - Migrating from zipfile/tarfile: migrating.md
  - Platforms and threading: support-matrix.md
  - Philosophy: philosophy.md
  - How it works: how-it-works.md
  - API reference: api.md
  - Acknowledgements: acknowledgements.md
```

The `Internal:`, `Grab-bag:`, and `Decisions:` nav sections are deleted (13 + ADR
entries). Published lines drop from **9,316** (all of `docs/**` today) to roughly
**1,550–1,800** — the 1,482-line guide, near-neutral through the splits, plus
`how-it-works.md`, minus the ~1,035-line ADR corpus. That estimate is approximate:
it assumes no new prose, and Topic 8 will legitimately grow `safe-extraction.md`
further. What is not approximate is that every published line is then for a user.

`Philosophy` moves down from position 2. It is a good page, but a reader who has
not yet installed the library does not need the manifesto before the install
instructions; `README.md` already carries the pitch.

## Guardrails (phase 4)

The brief calls phase 4 "the part most likely to be skipped and the part that
determines whether this review is worth doing twice." Three checks, cheapest first:

1. **Nav completeness.** Fail CI when a file under `docs/` is not in
   `mkdocs.yml`'s nav. `mkdocs build` already *prints* this — today it emits six
   such lines and exits 0 (verified: `mkdocs build --strict` is green at
   `ce674bf` while listing `decisions/0014-*` and five `internal/*` pages). The
   check is: parse that INFO line, exit non-zero if non-empty. This is what would
   have caught all six.
2. **Link checking**, three halves now that D3 is decided: internal relative links
   (`mkdocs --strict` covers cross-references but not arbitrary relative paths);
   the **absolute** `davitf.github.io` URLs in `README.md`, which nothing checks
   today and which freeze at the tag; and the **`github.com/davitf/archivey/blob/main/`
   URLs that D3 introduces into `docs/**`** — those point at files this migration
   is itself moving, so they are exactly the class that rots silently. D3 raises
   this guardrail from precautionary to load-bearing.
3. **The placement rule** (above) in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, next to the existing
   "Working with the specs" section.

A fourth, if the maintainer wants the invariant to be real rather than
conventional: fail CI when a new `docs/**` file is added without a nav entry *in
the same commit*. That is (1) and costs nothing extra.
