# `catalogue-neutral.md` — the problem catalogue, fields 1–3

**Derived, not authored.** Generated from [`catalogue.md`](catalogue.md) by
`scripts/derive_neutral_catalogue.py`, which strips field 4 ("Answer today") and the
per-entry source list. Edit `catalogue.md` and re-run the script; a test asserts this
file matches its output.

This is the artifact the fresh-design comparison is run against
([`experiment.md`](experiment.md)). It exists as a separate committed file so that
redaction is not a manual step at experiment time — the failure it prevents is handing a
frontier model the annotated catalogue by accident, which would invalidate the whole
exercise.

Each entry states a **problem** the world poses, the **symptom** someone observes, and the
**evidence** that it is real. What any particular library does about it is deliberately
absent. Categories: format quirk · upstream library defect · security / hostile input ·
platform & filesystem · performance & memory · API and usage pattern · packaging &
dependency · concurrency & lifetime.

Entry ids are stable and shared with the annotated catalogue, so a finding against an
entry here can be traced back.

## Format quirk

### FQ-01 — A member's true size and checksum can only be known after its bytes have been read

**Problem.** Several container formats place a member's uncompressed length and integrity
digest *after* the member's data rather than in a header before it: a gzip stream's CRC32
and length live in an 8-byte trailer, and a ZIP entry whose general-purpose flag bit 3 is
set carries zeros in its local header and its real sizes in a data descriptor following
the compressed bytes. A producer streaming into such a format cannot know the values in
advance, which is exactly why the formats allow this. So a listing taken before the data
is read is structurally incomplete, and the completion arrives in the middle of a read.

**Symptom.** A member's reported size is absent, zero, or wrong at listing time and
correct after the bytes have been consumed. Code that captured the metadata up front and
compared it with the delivered bytes reports a mismatch that does not exist. A consumer
that needs the length in order to preallocate, report progress, or enforce a limit has
nothing to work from on exactly the archives that stream.

**Evidence.** ZIP APPNOTE §4.3.9 (data descriptor) and §4.4.4 general-purpose bit 3;
RFC 1952 §2.3.1 (gzip `CRC32`/`ISIZE` trailer). Stated at
`dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:341-347` and `dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:73-88`.

---

### FQ-02 — A gzip stream's stored length is the true length modulo 2³²

**Problem.** The gzip trailer records the uncompressed size in a 32-bit field, so for any
payload of 4 GiB or more the stored value is the real size taken mod 2³². The field is not
optional and not marked unreliable; it is simply too narrow, and nothing in the stream says
which of the two readings applies.

**Symptom.** A large single-file compressed stream reports a plausible but wrong size —
a 5 GiB payload advertises 1 GiB. A completeness check that compares bytes delivered
against the stored length fails on a correct decode, or passes on a truncated one.

**Evidence.** RFC 1952 §2.3.1 (`ISIZE`, "the size of the original input data modulo 2^32").
Recorded at `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:949`.

---

### FQ-03 — A link's target is sometimes stored in the member's data, not its metadata

**Problem.** Formats disagree about where a symbolic link's target path lives. Some record
it as a header field; others store the link as an ordinary entry whose *content* is the
target string — which means the target is compressed, and if the archive is encrypted, the
target is encrypted too. Resolving such a link therefore requires decompressing (and
possibly a password), not just reading the index. Formats also disagree on whether a link
member has a data stream at all.

**Symptom.** An enumeration of the archive shows link entries whose targets are blank until
something reads their payloads. On an encrypted archive, merely resolving a link asks for a
password. A tool that resolves links during listing does far more work — and prompts far
more often — than the user expected from "list".

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:80-88` and `SPEC.md:386-390` (target "stored
in (or encrypted within) the member's data"); `SPEC.md:1000-1002` and
`ARCHITECTURE.md:1002-1011` for the per-format table. Measured per-format digest/data
comparison in `dev-docs/investigations/rar-corpus-sweep-diagnosis.md:66-76` (ZIP stores 9
bytes of target as data, 7z 45 bytes, TAR none, RAR5 none).

---

### FQ-04 — Some formats put their index at the end of the file

**Problem.** A ZIP file's authoritative table of contents is the central directory, located
at the end of the file and found by scanning backwards from the last bytes for the
end-of-central-directory record. Reading the archive's structure therefore requires
positioning at the end before anything else. This is the format working as designed —
appending to a ZIP means writing a new directory at the end — but it means the archive
cannot be understood from its first bytes.

**Symptom.** An archive arriving over a pipe, socket, or HTTP body cannot be listed at all
without first spooling the whole thing to memory or disk, however small the part of it the
caller wanted. The failure appears at open time, before any member is touched.

**Evidence.** ZIP APPNOTE §4.3.6 (overall `.ZIP` file format), §4.3.16 (end of central
directory record). Recorded at `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:902,911`;
`dev-docs/open-issues.md` §Irreducible ("ZIP / ISO need seek — no pure-pipe path").

---

### FQ-05 — Some formats have no index at all, so enumerating members costs a full read

**Problem.** A tar archive is a bare concatenation of 512-byte headers each followed by its
file's bytes. There is no table of contents anywhere in the file, so the only way to learn
what the archive contains is to walk every header, skipping over every payload — the whole
file. Wrapping that tar in a single compression stream makes it worse: reaching the next
header means decompressing everything before it.

**Symptom.** Asking "what is in this archive?" takes time proportional to the archive's
size rather than its member count, and on a compressed archive costs a full decompression.
The same question is answered instantly for a format with an index, so the cost is
invisible to a caller who does not know which format they hold.

**Evidence.** POSIX.1-2017 `pax` Interchange Format / ustar header block layout. Recorded
at `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:920` (listing cost "O(N) — no central directory") and
`dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:526-533`.

---

### FQ-06 — Solid compression makes one member's bytes depend on every earlier member's

**Problem.** Several formats compress many members as a single continuous stream (7z
folders, solid RAR blocks, and any tar wrapped in one compressor). This is why they compress
well: the codec's window spans file boundaries. The consequence is that member *k*'s bytes
cannot be produced without decoding members 1..*k*−1 first. Reading *n* members in
arbitrary order therefore costs O(n²) decode work, while reading them in archive order
costs one pass.

**Symptom.** A loop that opens each member by name and reads it — the obvious way to write
the code — takes quadratically longer than the same loop over a non-solid archive of the
same size, with no error and no warning; the archive just appears slow. Extracting a single
small file from the end of a large solid archive costs as much as extracting all of it.

**Evidence.** 7z folder/substream layout (a folder's decompressed output is the
concatenation of its files, sizes from the header): `dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:836-847`.
`dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:957,981`; `dev-docs/open-issues.md` §Irreducible ("Solid
archives: out-of-order `open()` can re-decode").

---

### FQ-07 — Member names are stored as bytes with no dependable statement of their encoding

**Problem.** Older archive formats predate Unicode and store names as raw bytes whose
encoding is either unstated or stated unreliably. ZIP has a general-purpose flag bit that
declares a name is UTF-8, and producers set it on names that are not UTF-8 and omit it on
names that are; unflagged names are nominally CP437 and in practice any local codepage. Some
RAR versions write filename fields that are malformed in their own declared encoding. There
is no in-band way to recover the intended characters, and a wrong guess is silent.

**Symptom.** Filenames appear as mojibake, or as replacement characters, or an archive that
other tools list fine cannot be listed at all because one name fails to decode. The same
archive shows different names under different tools.

**Evidence.** ZIP APPNOTE §4.4.4 (general purpose bit 11, "language encoding flag") and
APPNOTE Appendix D (CP437 default). `dev-docs/open-issues.md` P4 (a strict UTF-8 decode of
flagged names makes one bad name render the whole archive unlistable);
`dev-docs/history/COMPARISON.md:57,225` (RAR 2.9–4 UTF-16 filename corruption);
`history/SPEC.md:363-366,440-445` (the verbatim stored bytes are retained precisely so a
wrong guess can be undone).

---

### FQ-08 — Two members of one archive can carry the same name

**Problem.** Nothing in tar, 7z or ZIP requires member names to be unique. Tar's append mode
produces a second entry with the same name by design — that is how the format expresses "a
newer version of this file" — and a crafted or merely sloppy archive can contain any number
of same-named entries. There is no defined winner: the format states an order, not a
resolution.

**Symptom.** A listing shows N entries and extracting them produces fewer than N files, with
later ones silently overwriting earlier ones. A lookup by name returns one entry with no
indication that others exist, so a tool that round-trips "list, then fetch each by name"
loses data without any error.

**Evidence.** POSIX.1-2017 `pax`/ustar (append semantics; no uniqueness constraint).
Recorded at `dev-docs/history/COMPARISON.md:144` ("duplicate filenames are real (TAR, 7z)
and CSP's name-keyed model mishandles them") and `dev-docs/open-issues.md:233`.

---

### FQ-09 — Formats disagree about timestamp epoch, precision, and timezone

**Problem.** Each format records modification time in its own terms. The DOS date/time
field used by ZIP has 2-second granularity and no timezone, so it means local wall-clock at
the producer. Tar records a Unix timestamp, understood as UTC, with optional extended
headers carrying higher precision. Some formats record local time without an offset; others
record UTC with sub-second precision; others carry a second, higher-precision timestamp in
an optional extra field that disagrees with the mandatory one. None of these is convertible
to another without information the archive does not contain.

**Symptom.** Converting an archive from one format to another shifts or rounds every
timestamp. The same file listed from two formats shows two different times. A comparison
that expects equality across formats fails on legitimate archives, and a naive
local-vs-UTC read is wrong by the producer's offset.

**Evidence.** ZIP APPNOTE §4.4.6 (MS-DOS date/time, 2-second resolution) and §4.5.5 (extra
field `0x5455` extended timestamp); POSIX.1-2017 `pax` extended header keywords
(`mtime` with sub-second precision). Recorded at `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:906,927-928,
996-998` and `history/COMPARISON.md:57`.

---

### FQ-10 — Permissions and ownership are optional or absent in most formats

**Problem.** Unix mode bits, uid/gid and user/group names are not part of every archive
format's data model. ZIP carries them only when the producer was a Unix-like system and
wrote them into an external-attributes field; when it was not, the field is zero and means
nothing. 7z keeps POSIX attributes in an optional block a writer may omit entirely. Some
formats record only a Windows attribute word. A reader therefore cannot distinguish "mode
0" from "no mode recorded" from the stored bytes alone.

**Symptom.** Extracted files get whatever the umask allows rather than the modes they had,
or a tool that copies modes across a conversion writes mode 0 files. A member that a
different tool shows with permissions shows none here, or vice versa, and there is no error
either way.

**Evidence.** ZIP APPNOTE §4.4.15 (external file attributes) and §4.4.2.2 (version made by
/ host system). Recorded at `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:905,972` ("7z POSIX metadata lives in
an optional attribute block (absent → `mode`/`uid`/`gid` are `None`)").

---

### FQ-11 — ISO 9660 images carry the same tree several times, at different fidelity

**Problem.** An ISO 9660 image can describe its contents in up to three parallel
namespaces: the base standard (names truncated to 8.3 and case-folded, no POSIX metadata),
Joliet (long UCS-2 names in a supplementary volume descriptor), and Rock Ridge (POSIX
metadata, long names, symlinks, as extensions to the base records). They are views of the
same extents, and an image may carry any combination. Nothing designates one as canonical.

**Symptom.** The same disc image lists as `README.TXT;1` under one tool and `ReadMe.txt`
under another, with symlinks and permissions present in one listing and absent in the
other. Which one a caller gets depends on a choice they did not know was being made.

**Evidence.** ECMA-119 (ISO 9660) §6.8/§8.4 (primary and supplementary volume descriptors);
the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol and Joliet specifications. Recorded at
`dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:1016`.

---

### FQ-12 — Some compressed formats have no magic bytes to detect them by

**Problem.** Identifying a compressed stream normally means matching a fixed byte signature
at a fixed offset. Brotli has no such signature: a raw brotli stream begins with the first
bits of its own compressed data. It is not merely undocumented — the format deliberately
spends no bytes on a header. Nor does it carry a length or checksum trailer.

**Symptom.** A file cannot be identified as brotli from its contents at all; identification
falls back to the filename, which may be absent (a stream) or wrong. And because there is
no trailer, a brotli stream cut short cannot be distinguished from one that ended.

**Evidence.** RFC 7932 (brotli; no container header, no trailing checksum). Recorded at
`dev-docs/library-analysis.md:57,309-315` and `history/COMPARISON.md:205`.

---

### FQ-13 — The same compressed bytes may be a single file or a whole archive

**Problem.** A gzip, bzip2, xz or zstd stream says nothing about what it contains. The
overwhelmingly common case is a tar archive, but the identical outer format is also used for
a single compressed file, and the outer header cannot distinguish them. Extensions
distinguish them by convention only, and only when a filename exists.

**Symptom.** The same bytes present as one member named after the file, or as hundreds of
members, depending on a guess. A caller iterating "the members of this archive" gets one
opaque blob where they expected a directory tree, or vice versa.

**Evidence.** RFC 1952 (gzip: `FNAME` is optional and carries no content type). Recorded at
`dev-docs/history/COMPARISON.md:205` ("decompress a sample to find tar inside gz/bz2/xz/zstd
— disambiguates `.tar.gz` from `.gz`") and `history/SPEC.md:936`.

---

### FQ-14 — Identifying bytes are not always near the start of the file

**Problem.** Format signatures sit wherever the format put them. A tar archive's `ustar`
magic is at offset 257, inside the first header block. An ISO 9660 image's `CD001` is at
offset 32 769 — sector 16 — because the first 32 KiB is a reserved system area. A
self-extracting archive prepends an entire executable, so its archive signature is at an
offset nothing declares. A bounded read sized for the common case cannot see these.

**Symptom.** A format is not recognized, or recognition requires buffering far more of an
incoming stream than the caller expected; and a stream shorter than the signature's offset
is simply undecidable — it might be a valid short file of another format, or a truncated one
of this.

**Evidence.** ECMA-119 §6.2.1 (system area, first 16 logical sectors); POSIX ustar header
`magic` field at offset 257. Recorded at `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:766-782` (magic table
with offsets, and the ISO caveat requiring a 32 774-byte peek) and `history/COMPARISON.md:205`
(SFX executables with embedded archives).

---

### FQ-15 — Detection has to read bytes it is not allowed to consume

**Problem.** Deciding what a stream is requires reading its first bytes. If the stream
cannot be rewound — a pipe, a socket, an HTTP body — those bytes are gone once read, and the
consumer that needs them can no longer see them. The decision and the consumption are the
same act on a forward-only source.

**Symptom.** Either detection succeeds and the parser then fails on a stream missing its
first bytes, or detection is skipped and the caller must declare the format. A caller who
calls a standalone "what is this?" helper on a stream they intend to keep reading silently
damages it.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:764,784-804`; `history/ARCHITECTURE.md:274-299`.

---

### FQ-16 — A codec chain can include a filter that is not one-in-one-out

**Problem.** Most compressed-member layouts are a linear pipeline: each stage takes one byte
stream and produces one. 7z's BCJ2 breaks that shape — it is a branch-conversion filter with
four input streams that must be consumed in a data-dependent interleaving. A decoder built
around a linear chain has no place to put it, and feeding BCJ2's streams as if they were one
produces plausible-looking output that is wrong.

**Symptom.** Either an archive using this filter cannot be read, or it is read and yields
corrupted bytes that no checksum was consulted to reject.

**Evidence.** 7-Zip's BCJ2 coder definition (four packed streams: main, call, jump, range
coder). Recorded at `dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:854-855,961` and
`history/SPEC.md:963-964`.

---

### FQ-17 — One widely used archive format is proprietary and specified only by its own tool

**Problem.** The RAR compression algorithms are proprietary. There is no published
specification of the decompressor; the format is documented only through reverse engineering
and its reference implementation is the vendor's own extraction tool, whose license forbids
using it to build a competing compressor. Metadata layout has been reverse-engineered
successfully, but the entropy coder has not been independently reimplemented.

**Symptom.** Reading the bytes of a RAR member requires an external program that the user
must install separately and that is not redistributable, so the same code path works or
fails depending on the host. Listing an archive and reading it have different requirements.

**Evidence.** RARLAB `unrar` source license (permits decompression, forbids reverse
engineering to create a RAR compressor). Recorded at
`dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:882-885` and `dev-docs/threat-model.md:347-359` (C1: the
decompressor matrix — `unrar` non-free, `unrar-free` handles little of RAR5, `7z`/`bsdtar`
coverage varies by build, `unar` on macOS).

---

### FQ-18 — Formats differ on whether a link member carries a data stream, and on what its digest covers

**Problem.** A format may express a symbolic or hard link as a redirect recorded in the
entry's metadata with no payload, or as an ordinary entry whose payload is the target path.
Both shapes coexist across formats and even across versions of one format. Where there is
no payload but the format still has a mandatory checksum field, the field is populated with
the checksum of zero bytes — a fixed value that describes nothing and distinguishes no link
from another. A reader keying on member *type* rather than on the storage shape gets it
wrong in one direction or the other.

**Symptom.** A link's advertised digest is a constant (the CRC32 of the empty string) that
does not match its target string, while its advertised size is the target's length — two
fields describing different things. Code that trusts stored digests to identify content
without decompressing sees every link in every archive as identical.

**Evidence.** Measured across four formats in
`dev-docs/investigations/rar-corpus-sweep-diagnosis.md:58-89`: ZIP symlink digest
`0x2d212004` = `crc32(target)`, 9 bytes stored; 7z `0x2b4106af` = `crc32(target)`, 45 bytes;
TAR no digest; RAR5 `0x00000000`, **0 bytes stored** (`unrar lt` reports `Packed size: 0`).
RAR3/4 stores the target as member data, so its CRC32 *is* a genuine digest of it.

---

### FQ-19 — A hard link points backwards; a symbolic link may point anywhere

**Problem.** The two link kinds have different resolution rules. A hard link entry in a tar
archive names a target that must already have appeared earlier in the archive — that is what
makes single-pass extraction possible. A symbolic link stores an arbitrary path string,
which may name a later member, a member that is not in the archive at all, an absolute path,
a path outside the archive's tree, or another link forming a cycle. Nothing in the archive
validates it.

**Symptom.** Extraction has to create a link whose target does not exist yet, or does not
exist at all; a chain of links resolves indefinitely or loops; and a link may point at a
destination outside where extraction was asked to write.

**Evidence.** POSIX.1-2017 `pax` `LNKTYPE`/`SYMTYPE` semantics (link name refers to a
previously archived file). Recorded at `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:168`,
`history/ARCHITECTURE.md:202-207,349,374`, and the adversarial-corpus obligations at
`history/SPEC.md:1140-1141`.

---

### FQ-20 — A run of zero bytes is a legal, complete, empty tar archive, at many different lengths

**Problem.** A tar archive ends with two 512-byte blocks of zeros, and writers pad beyond
that to a record boundary whose size is a documented, caller-settable option. An empty
archive therefore contains no non-zero byte anywhere, and its length varies by writer and
by flag. A file of nothing but zeros, at any block-aligned length, satisfies the format's
definition of a valid archive containing no members — and so does a sparse file, a
partially written file on a zero-filling filesystem, or a never-written disk region. The
format's identifying bytes are inside a *member header*, so an empty archive has no header
to carry them: there is nothing in the content to confirm or deny that this is an archive
at all. There is no predicate over the bytes that separates the cases, because there is no
difference between them.

**Symptom.** A file that is obviously not an archive is accepted and reported as an
archive with zero members. A verification pass over a corrupt or never-written region
reports success. Conversely, any rule that rejects it also rejects the most widely
distributed empty archive in existence.

**Evidence.** Measured in ADR
[`0015-zero-filled-files-are-valid-empty-tars`](../../dev-docs/decisions/0015-zero-filled-files-are-valid-empty-tars.md):
`tar -b 64 -cf e64.tar --files-from /dev/null` produces a file **byte-identical** to
`b"\x00" * 32768` (same sha256, and `tar -tvf` lists it with exit 0), and every documented
blocking factor from `-b 1` to `-b 128` yields another valid all-zero length. Python's
`tarfile` emits 10 240 bytes; Go's `archive/tar` emits 1 024 — and Go's empty archive
(sha256 `5f70bf18…`) **is the Docker/OCI empty-layer blob**, carried by every image with a
metadata-only layer. Surveyed on a development machine: 87 % of real archives are
10 240-aligned against 5 % of Go's test corpus. POSIX.1-2017 `pax` end-of-archive marker;
ustar `magic` at offset 257, inside a header.

---

### FQ-21 — Multi-file archives spread one logical archive over several files

**Problem.** Formats support splitting an archive across volumes: numbered parts that must
be concatenated, or addressed as separate "disks" by the index. A ZIP's central directory
records which disk each entry starts on; RAR volumes chain by naming convention. A member's
data may straddle a volume boundary. Opening the file the user names gives access to only
part of the archive, and the remaining parts may be absent.

**Symptom.** An archive opens and lists but reading a member fails partway, or the archive
does not open at all because the part naming the index is a different file than the one
opened. A member larger than a volume cannot be read from any single file.

**Evidence.** ZIP APPNOTE §8 (splitting and spanning). Recorded at `dev-docs/open-issues.md`
P2 ("Multi-volume / split ZIP (`.z01`…`.zip`) … detected and rejected") and
`history/SPEC.md:994` (RAR volume joining).

---

### FQ-22 — A format may record file version history as ordinary members

**Problem.** Some formats can store several revisions of the same path in one archive, as
distinct entries distinguished by a version marker rather than by name. To a reader that
does not know the marker, they are duplicate names (FQ-08); to one that does, they are a
history the archive's own tool displays separately from the current contents.

**Symptom.** A listing shows several entries for one path, and extracting them all writes
each over the last, leaving whichever the archive happened to order last.

**Evidence.** RAR file-version records (`unrar` `-ver` switch). Recorded at
`dev-docs/open-issues.md:232` ("RAR5 `-ver` history rows in `members()`") and specified in
`openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-15-rar-file-version-members/`.

---

### FQ-23 — A decoder that over-reads its input lets a container store one byte less than the decoder needs

**Problem.** Some entropy coders read slightly beyond the bytes that carry information: a
range decoder normalizing near the end of a stream can demand one more input byte than the
payload strictly required. The reference implementation's input wrapper handles this by
returning zero past the end of the buffer and counting the over-reads. That behaviour is
load-bearing rather than incidental — because the decoder tolerates a synthetic zero at the
tail, a *writer* is free to store the stream with a trailing zero byte trimmed. A binding
whose reader instead blocks when its input is exhausted cannot decode such a member at all:
it waits forever for a byte the container deliberately did not store.

There is also a widely repeated misreading of this: the convention is often described as the
*encoder* omitting a final zero byte. It does not — the flush emits a fixed number of bytes
unconditionally. It is a container storage optimization that depends on the *decoder's*
over-read, and confusing the two leads to looking for the missing byte in the wrong place.

**Symptom.** A member written by the reference tool decodes to one byte short of its declared
size and then hangs, or reports needing input that does not exist. The same content written by
a different tool round-trips fine, so the failure looks like corruption in specific archives.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/investigations/ppmd-native-investigation-results.md:85-141`, from
source: the encoder's flush "always emits 5 range-coder bytes … **There is no code that omits
a trailing `0x00`**", so the binding's own documentation sentence "is therefore **not** a
description of" its encoder; the decoder's one-byte tail lookahead is at `Ppmd7Dec.c:26`; the
reference tool's wrapper "**returns `0` and bumps an 'extra bytes' counter** once the buffer
is exhausted"; and the binding's reader blocks instead (`ThreadDecoder.c:70-81`). Measured:
round-trips through the binding's own encoder needed the synthetic byte in **0 of 60 768**
trials — which is why the requirement is invisible until a real-world archive arrives.

---

### FQ-24 — Some formats record the *deletion* of a file as a member, and most do not

**Problem.** A format that supports updating an archive in place needs a way to say "this
path is gone", and the way to say it is another entry — a tombstone with no content, or a
newer same-named entry that supersedes the old one. Formats differ in whether they have this
concept at all, in whether they mark the superseded entry, and in how they present the
history: one marks the older entry as no longer current, another gives each revision a
distinct name, and a third simply leaves both entries live and says nothing. So "what does
this archive currently contain?" is a per-format computation over the member list, not a
property of it — and for a forward-only pass it is not computable at all, because
last-entry-wins cannot be known before the last entry is seen.

**Symptom.** The same logical situation — two entries with one name — produces three
different outcomes across formats: one silently skips the older entry, one shows both under
different names, and one fails the whole extraction. An archive as ordinary as an
appended-to tarball is the failing case. A tombstone entry is reported as an existing file.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-19-api-coherence/SUMMARY.md` finding P1, with a
runnable reproduction in that review's `parity.md`: 7z marks the older entry not-current and
default extraction skips it; RAR gives history rows distinct names; ZIP and TAR leave both
current and default extraction **fails** on `tar -rf` output. The same review's
`members-scope.md` records why a default-exclude is unimplementable for a forward-only tar
pass, and that tombstone entries are themselves *current*, so "current only" still shows
them.

---

### FQ-25 — An index over a multi-stream compressed file legitimately holds several entries for one offset

**Problem.** When a compressed file is a concatenation of independent streams, an index of
restart points naturally contains more than one entry at the same *uncompressed* offset: the
start of a stream and the start of that stream's first block are the same output position but
different decoder states, and a zero-length block adds another entry at the position it
neither starts nor ends. So the output offset is not a key — several distinct, equally valid
restart descriptions can share it, and code that treats a repeat as impossible is wrong on
ordinary files, not just crafted ones.

**Symptom.** Concatenating two valid compressed files and reading the result with the
everyday "seek to the end for the size, then read" pattern fails, or seeks to the wrong
place. A short crafted file fails during index construction before any data is decoded.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-16-stream-decoder/SUMMARY.md` finding F1, with two
independent triggers found by two parallel reviews: **(a)** a *valid* multi-stream `.xz`
read with the size-probe-then-read pattern, where a stream-start point collides with a
first-block point; **(b)** a 72-byte crafted `.xz` with two or more zero-length blocks,
which index construction alone maps to one offset with distinct block descriptions. The xz
container specification permits both shapes. That review also records why no existing test
could catch it: every seek test read forward to end-of-file *before* seeking, the one
ordering that hides trigger (a).

### FQ-26 — A format that encrypts its index cannot be listed without the key

**Problem.** Header encryption means the table of contents is ciphertext. Enumerating
members therefore requires the password *at open time*, before any member's data is
considered — which is the exact opposite of the ordinary case, where listing is free and only
reading data needs a key. Any rule of the form "no password is requested until you read a
member" is unachievable for these archives, as a matter of format law rather than
implementation.

**Symptom.** Opening an archive prompts for a password when the caller only wanted to see
what was inside, on some archives of a format and not others — and the difference is not
visible from the outside.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-08-15-simplicity-consistency/SUMMARY.md` finding F9,
classified as "format law + docs gap": header-encrypted 7z and RAR require the password at
open "(format law — the listing is ciphertext)" while the published laziness rule stated no
bound. `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:1004` (header encryption: "listing requires the password").

---

### FQ-27 — A block-transform codec emits nothing until an entire block has been read

**Problem.** Stream-oriented codecs produce output incrementally, so a few kilobytes of
compressed input already yields decompressed bytes. Block-transform codecs do not: bzip2
applies a Burrows–Wheeler transform over a block of up to 900 KB and emits nothing until the
whole block has been consumed. Anything that identifies content by decompressing a bounded
prefix therefore works for every stream codec and fails for this one — and it fails in a
data-dependent way, on exactly the archives whose first member is incompressible, because
those are the ones whose first block exceeds the prefix.

**Symptom.** A compressed tar archive is reported as a single opaque compressed file rather
than an archive with members, for a large fraction of real-world files of that codec — and
the filename does not rescue it, because content identification outranks the extension. A
`.tar.bz2` whose leading member holds even a few kilobytes of already-compressed data is the
failing case.

**Evidence.** The bzip2 format's block structure (blocks of 100–900 KB, BWT applied per
block). Stated with the failure mechanism in
`openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-04-inner-tar-probe-block-codecs/proposal.md`: the probe
"decompresses only the peeked detection prefix (4096 bytes) … the codec raises
[a truncation error] on the prefix, the probe returns `False`, and the archive is mis-reported as
a bare `.bz2`. There is no open-time re-probe … This affects a large fraction of real-world
`.tar.bz2` files".

---

### FQ-28 — A single forward pass can resolve only backward references

**Problem.** Links inside an archive may point in either direction, but a forward-only pass
sees each member exactly once and in order. A hard link, which by format rule refers to an
earlier member, resolves as the pass runs. A symbolic link whose target appears *later* cannot
be resolved when it is yielded, and by the time the target arrives the link has already been
handed to the caller. So a forward pass and a random-access listing cannot produce the same
resolved objects, and no amount of bookkeeping closes the gap — the information does not
exist yet at the moment it is needed.

**Symptom.** Iterating an archive from a pipe yields link members whose targets are
unresolved, while listing the same archive from a file resolves them. Advice of the form
"iterate, discarding the members, then ask for the list" produces a listing that is not the
listing the other mode gives.

**Evidence.** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-07-scan-members/proposal.md`: "a single
forward pass resolves only **backward-pointing** links; **forward-pointing symlinks stay
unresolved**, so a bare iteration can never yield the same resolved objects that random-access
`members()` produces." The hard-link direction rule is POSIX.1-2017 `pax` `LNKTYPE`
(FQ-19).

---

### FQ-29 — A format's only integrity signal may be a hash the platform cannot compute

**Problem.** Formats choose their own digest algorithms, and not every choice is available
in a standard library. One archive format's members may carry a parallel tree-hash variant
instead of a checksum — the same underlying function as a widely available hash, but composed
over a tree of parallel lanes with specific parameters, and exposed by no standard hashing
module. Where that hash is the member's *only* integrity signal, a reader that cannot compute
it cannot verify the member at all, and the natural failure mode is silent: the hasher lookup
returns nothing and verification quietly becomes an advisory.

**Symptom.** A corrupted member of one specific format reads back as clean, on precisely the
members that chose the stronger hash. Nothing raises, and the only trace is an advisory that
the digest could not be checked.

**Evidence.** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-14-rar-blake2sp-verification/proposal.md`:
"`hashlib` has no `blake2sp` (only `blake2b`/`blake2s`), so `_make_hasher("blake2sp")` returns
`None` and the read **silently degrades** … a corrupted BLAKE2sp-only RAR5 member is read back
as clean today", with two specifications recorded as disagreeing about it as a result. The
algorithm is BLAKE2sp, the parallel tree mode of BLAKE2s.

---

### FQ-30 — A name that is not valid UTF-8 and carries no encoding marker cannot be decoded correctly by any means

**Problem.** FQ-07 is that formats do not dependably say what encoding a name is in. This is
why that cannot be worked around. UTF-8 is self-checking: most byte sequences are not valid
UTF-8, so a successful decode is near-conclusive evidence, and validating it is not a guess.
Every legacy single-byte codepage is the opposite — latin-1, cp1252, cp437, cp850, the
ISO-8859 family are all *total functions* over bytes. Each one decodes *any* input, just to
different characters. There is no signal to prefer one over another, and the usual fallback,
statistical detection, needs far more text than a filename provides: the non-ASCII portion is
often one or two bytes.

So for the genuinely legacy tail there is no oracle, and the choice is between an honest,
visibly-undecodable, byte-exact rendering and a plausible-looking name that may be silently
wrong and may not round-trip. The wrong guess is strictly worse than the garble, because the
garble tells the user something is wrong and preserves the bytes.

**Symptom.** A filename from an old archive renders with visible replacement characters or
escapes, and there is no setting that fixes it — only settings that change which wrong name
appears. Two different tools show two different plausible names for the same bytes and neither
is verifiable.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/IDEAS.md` §"Opt-in legacy name-encoding detection", which states the
undecidability directly: "Legacy detection has **no oracle**: latin-1 / cp1252 / cp437 /
cp850 / ISO-8859-x are all total functions over bytes (each decodes *any* input, just to
different characters), and filenames are far too short for statistical detectors
(chardet / charset-normalizer) to be reliable — often 1–2 non-ASCII bytes." The three affected
format families are enumerated there, including one whose header format "has no charset field
at all". Contrast with the shipped case: the UTF-8 sniff "is *validation*, not guessing —
UTF-8 is self-checking, so a clean decode is near-conclusive"
(`2026-07-14-zip-name-encoding-sniffing`), whose `design.md` records the detector
investigation: both candidate libraries "are tuned for *documents* (paragraphs)", "frequently
disagree on short strings", and "can even override a valid-UTF-8 string with a legacy guess —
strictly worse", with one of them under a copyleft licence besides.

An off-the-shelf statistical detector does not rescue this and can make it worse: it may
override a *valid* UTF-8 string with a legacy guess, which is strictly worse than the case
already handled correctly. And the honest approach has its own residual — a short legacy byte
run that is coincidentally valid UTF-8 decodes as UTF-8 — which is rare and still better than
the alternative for the common case.

### FQ-31 — A file of concatenated compressed members has a trailer per member, not one for the file

**Problem.** Several single-stream compressed formats are legally concatenated: a gzip file may
be many complete gzip members end to end, and decompressing it yields their outputs joined.
Each member carries its own trailer, so the file has *n* checksums and *n* lengths, and the last
one describes only the last member. Presenting the whole file as one logical member therefore
leaves no honest value for its checksum: the final trailer is the wrong answer, and combining
them requires knowing where the boundaries are — which the format does not index and a
random-access index does not record (UL-07).

**Symptom.** A digest read cheaply from a compressed file's trailer matches only files that
happen to contain exactly one member, and silently describes a suffix of the data for every
other file. A caller using stored digests to identify content without decompressing gets a
value that is not a digest of what they will receive.

**Evidence.** RFC 1952 §2.2 ("a gzip file consists of a series of 'members'"). Stated as the
constraint in
`openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-14-stored-digest-dedupe-parity/design.md`: "A concatenated
multi-member gzip's final trailer CRC covers only the last member; a single `Member` cannot
honestly carry it. Reuse the existing member-count detection from the truncation backstop:
surface `crc32` iff exactly one member, else omit."

## Security / hostile input

### SEC-01 — A member name can name a destination outside where extraction was asked to write

**Problem.** An archive member's name is an arbitrary string chosen by whoever built the
archive. Joined to a destination directory it can escape it: `../` components walk upward,
a leading `/` or a drive letter makes it absolute, and a platform-specific separator or an
encoded form can slip past a check written for the other spelling. The archive format
imposes no constraint — a name is a name.

**Symptom.** Extracting an untrusted archive writes files outside the directory the user
chose, overwriting whatever the process has permission to overwrite.

**Evidence.** CWE-22; the adversarial-corpus obligations at `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:1138-1139`
(`../evil`, `../../etc/passwd`, `./../../outside`, `/etc/passwd`,
`C:\Windows\System32\evil.dll`). Layered defence recorded at
`history/ARCHITECTURE.md:683-698`.

---

### SEC-02 — An archive can rewrite its own destination as it is being extracted

**Problem.** An extraction that writes members in archive order gives the archive control
over the filesystem it is writing into. An early member can create a symbolic link, or a
directory that is a link, and a later member's path then resolves *through* that link to
somewhere else. Every member's name may have been validated as relative and contained, and
the write can still land outside, because the path's meaning changed after the check. The
archive supplies both the link and the file that follows it.

**Symptom.** An extraction of an archive whose every member name looks harmless writes
outside the destination. Each individual check passes; the sequence defeats them.

**Evidence.** CWE-367 (time-of-check/time-of-use); chained-symlink cases in the
adversarial-corpus obligations at `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:1140`. Layer 3 rationale at
`history/ARCHITECTURE.md:693,697-698`.

---

### SEC-03 — Compressed data can expand without bound, and the archive declares the expansion

**Problem.** Compression ratios are unbounded in principle: a few kilobytes of highly
redundant input decompresses to gigabytes, and archives can nest so that each layer
multiplies. The declared uncompressed size in the header is attacker-controlled and need not
match what actually comes out. So neither the input size nor the declared output size bounds
the work an extraction will do.

**Symptom.** Extracting a small file fills the disk or exhausts memory. A process that
sized its buffers or its progress bar from the declared size is wrong by orders of
magnitude, in either direction.

**Evidence.** The `42.zip` family (outer layer ~391:1; nested layers multiply);
`dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:814-824` and `SPEC.md:1136,1144` (adversarial corpus:
zip bombs, and "member claims 1 TiB size but archive is 1 KiB").

---

### SEC-04 — Legitimate files reach compression ratios that look like an attack

**Problem.** A ratio threshold cannot separate hostile from benign input, because benign
input reaches extreme ratios routinely: ten bytes of a repeated character compress to a few
bytes and expand back at whatever ratio the sizes happen to give, and sparse or
zero-padded files compress arbitrarily well. The ratio of a small file is dominated by
per-member overhead and carries no information about intent.

**Symptom.** A guard tuned to catch bombs rejects ordinary archives — a 10-byte file
expanding to 15 KiB presents a 1500:1 ratio — so the guard is either loose enough to be
useless or tight enough to break real workloads.

**Evidence.** The false-positive obligation is pinned as a required adversarial-corpus case
at `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:1137` ("a tiny but highly-compressible legitimate file (e.g.
10 bytes → 15 KiB, 1500:1) — verify it extracts **without** error"). Typical ratios for
comparison at `history/ARCHITECTURE.md:820`.

---

### SEC-05 — Enumerating an archive's metadata is itself unbounded work

**Problem.** The cost of *listing* an archive is attacker-controlled independently of its
data. A small file can declare an enormous number of entries, or entries with enormous
names, comments and extended attributes; an indexed format's header can claim a member count
that the reader will allocate for before reading any member. None of this requires
decompressing anything, so limits placed on extraction do not apply.

**Symptom.** Merely opening or listing an untrusted archive exhausts memory, with no member
ever read and no byte ever written to disk.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:18-32` (O1: `max_members`, `max_metadata_bytes`;
"indexed formats (7z/RAR) may still allocate up to those parser ceilings during
[open] before [the listing] caps apply"). Specified in
`openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-12-listing-resource-limits/`.

---

### SEC-06 — Two names that differ in the archive are one file on the filesystem

**Problem.** Archive formats compare names as byte strings; filesystems often do not. On a
default Windows or macOS volume, `README` and `readme` are the same file, and so are the
NFC and NFD spellings of `café` — two distinct, legal archive members that cannot both
exist on disk. The archive is not malformed and the filesystem is not wrong; they simply
disagree about identity.

**Symptom.** Extracting an archive produces fewer files than it has members, silently, on
some machines and not others. Under a fail-on-existing policy it instead reports a confusing
"already exists" for a file the extraction itself just wrote.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:34-58` (O2, with the pre-fix behaviour recorded);
Unicode Standard Annex #15 (normalization forms). Decided in ADR
[`0013-cross-platform-name-safety-policies`](../../dev-docs/decisions/0013-cross-platform-name-safety-policies.md).

---

### SEC-07 — A platform can silently rewrite the name it was asked to write

**Problem.** Win32 does not store every name it accepts. A trailing dot or space is trimmed
away, so `stuff_etc.` becomes `stuff_etc`. A name matching a reserved device name — `CON`,
`NUL`, `COM1` — refers to a device, not a file. A `:` in a name selects an NTFS alternate
data stream, producing a hidden stream on another file instead of a file. These are all
legitimate names on macOS and Linux, so an archive built there carries them innocently.

**Symptom.** The file that appears on disk has a different name than the one reported, or
two members collapse onto one name, or the write goes to a device or an invisible stream. No
error is raised, because the platform considers the operation successful. And because these
names appear in *path segments*, refusing one is not a per-member decision: a rejected
directory segment takes every member beneath it — reported as one failure if the run aborts,
or silently dropped along with its whole subtree if the run continues.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:60-84` (O3, O4). The subtree consequence is a
real-world report recorded in ADR 0013 decision 4: a macOS zip containing a `stuff_etc.`
folder failed an entire extraction, and under continue-on-error would instead "*silently
drop the folder and every file under it*, since they share the segment". Decided in ADR
[`0013-cross-platform-name-safety-policies`](../../dev-docs/decisions/0013-cross-platform-name-safety-policies.md).

---

### SEC-08 — A name can be representable as bytes and still unwritable

**Problem.** A member name that decodes to a valid string, and that the operating system's
encoding layer will accept, can still be refused by the filesystem at the moment of writing:
a name carrying bytes that are not valid UTF-8 fails with an encoding error on a volume that
requires UTF-8, while the same name works on a volume that does not care. Separately, a name
containing a lone surrogate cannot be encoded to filesystem bytes at all. Representability is
a property of the target volume, not of the name.

**Symptom.** A per-member write failure that depends on which filesystem the destination is
on, surfacing as a low-level operating-system error partway through an otherwise successful
extraction.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:162-181` (O7, naming `caf\udce9.txt` → `EILSEQ` on
APFS); pinning test `tests/test_extraction.py:253`
(`test_unrepresentable_name_oserror_is_translated`). PEP 383 (surrogateescape).

---

### SEC-09 — Member names are attacker-controlled text that ends up on a terminal

**Problem.** Whoever builds an archive chooses its member names, and those names are what
every tool prints when reporting on the archive. A name may contain ANSI control sequences,
carriage returns, or line separators: `README\x1b[2K\rSUCCESS.txt` printed raw erases the
line it is being reported on and writes the attacker's text in its place. The operator sees
a report the archive authored. This is not specific to any one message — every path, error
string, log record and progress line derived from a member name has the same property, and
the failure paths report the name too, so refusing to write it does not remove the exposure.

**Symptom.** Listing or extracting a hostile archive produces terminal output that
misrepresents what happened — a blocked member reported as succeeded, a path that reads as a
different path — with no indication that anything was rewritten.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:240-343` (O9), including a reproduction on `main`
showing a library log record emitting the unescaped name one line before the fixed print
site, and the note that Windows refuses control bytes in filenames (`WinError 123`) yet the
failure path is itself a reporting path. GNU `ls`/`tar` quote output for the same reason.
Pinning tests: `tests/test_escaping.py`, `tests/test_cli.py::test_extract_escapes_*`.

---

### SEC-10 — Escaping text for display is itself easy to get wrong

**Problem.** Rendering arbitrary text inertly requires deciding which code points to escape
and how. A hand-written escape table gets edge cases wrong in ways that are invisible on
ordinary input: an astral code point emitted as a five-hex-digit `\uXXXXX` escape reads back
as a different character; the range of code points that a filesystem-byte round-trip
actually produces is narrower than the full surrogate block, so escaping the wrong range
turns valid characters into bytes they never came from; and distinct inputs can render
identically, so a claim that the rendering is reversible is false.

**Symptom.** An escaped name is not the name — it reads back as different text — and two
different members render as the same string. Nothing detects this, because the affected code
points do not occur in test data drawn from real archives.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:332-339`: three bugs found by review in a
hand-rolled table — 955 086 code points affected by the five-hex-digit form; the
surrogateescape range stated as `U+DC00`–`U+DFFF` rather than the `U+DC80`–`U+DCFF` that
PEP 383 actually produces, reversing 768 code points; and `U+009B` colliding with an escaped
byte `0x9B`. Pinning tests in `tests/test_escaping.py`.

---

### SEC-11 — An archive can be a container for itself

**Problem.** Archives can contain archives, and nothing bounds the nesting. A file can be
constructed to contain itself — a quine — so any process that opens nested archives
recursively never terminates. The founding use case for a library like this (indexing
backups) does exactly that recursion, so the hazard is on the main path, not an exotic one.

**Symptom.** A tool that descends into nested archives loops forever, or exhausts memory, on
an archive that opens and lists perfectly at every individual level.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:154-160` (O6, naming `droste.zip`).

---

### SEC-12 — A corrupted header can make a member name the destination itself

**Problem.** A member whose name normalizes to the current directory — `.` — is not a
traversal: it stays inside the destination. But if such a member is typed as a *file* rather
than a directory, writing it means writing *through* the destination path, replacing the
directory being extracted into with a regular file. A single bit flip in a header produces
this, so it does not require a deliberate attacker.

**Symptom.** An extraction replaces its own output directory with a file; subsequent members
then fail, or the caller finds a file where it expected a tree.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:144-152`, found by the corpus mutation harness
(`bitflip@107:0x10` on `adversarial-tar.tar.gz`). Pinning tests
`tests/test_extraction.py:154` (`test_check_universal_rejects_root_named_file`) and
`test_extract_error_when_dest_is_a_file`.

---

### SEC-13 — A format with no password verifier cannot tell a wrong password from corrupt data

**Problem.** Some encrypted formats store a value that lets a reader check a candidate
password cheaply before decrypting anything — RAR5's password-check field, WinZip AES's
verifier bytes. 7z stores none. Decryption with a wrong key therefore succeeds at the
cipher level and yields garbage, and the only signal is whether the garbage happens to fail
the next stage: a decompressor on random input, or a header parser on random bytes. Garbage
sometimes parses. In particular, a header parser that stops at the first structural
terminator will accept random output whose first byte happens to be that terminator, and
report a well-formed archive containing nothing.

**Symptom.** Opening a header-encrypted archive with the wrong password returns an archive
with zero members and no error. A verification or indexing tool concludes "empty archive"
where the truth is "wrong password", and reports success. The rate depends on the random
salt chosen when the archive was written, so it is per-archive, not per-attempt, and it
looks like a flaky test rather than a systematic hole.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:183-238` (O8). Measured: **~0.3 % of salts slip both
checks** (2/300, 3/1110 across runs); of 8 observed slips, 7 were a leading `END` property
id and 1 was `HEADER`+`END`, matching the ≈1/256 chance that the first garbage byte is
`0x00`. Also the root cause of a long-standing intermittent test failure. Pinning test
`tests/test_sevenzip_reader.py:460`
(`test_header_encrypted_empty_decoded_header_rejected`).

---

### SEC-14 — A cheap password check has a false-accept rate

**Problem.** Where a format *does* provide a password verifier, it is often narrow — a
single byte — because it was designed to reject most wrong passwords quickly, not to be
authoritative. A one-byte check accepts a wrong password roughly once in 256 attempts. On an
archive whose members may use different passwords, confirming which password belongs to which
member therefore cannot rely on the verifier alone, and the fallback is to decrypt and check
the member's real checksum — which for a stored (uncompressed) member means reading it.

**Symptom.** A wrong password appears to be accepted, and the error surfaces later as
corrupt data. Because the real check only runs while the member is read, a wrong candidate
that passed the cheap check *shadows* a later correct one, and the failure presents as
corruption rather than as a password problem. Determining the right password for each member
of a multi-password archive costs a full read of members rather than a header check.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/open-issues.md` §Irreducible ("ZipCrypto multi-password + STORED
confirmation cost (~1/256 false open → CRC scan)"); ZIP APPNOTE §7 (traditional PKWARE
encryption, 12-byte header with a one-byte password check). Specified in
`openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-11-zip-multipassword-disambiguation/`, whose `design.md`
explains why the cost lands on *stored* members specifically: a wrong key hands a
**decompressor** high-entropy garbage, which each codec rejects within a few bytes for
structural reasons — deflate hits an invalid block type, invalid code lengths, or a
stored-block length/complement mismatch; bzip2's stream and block magic fail immediately; raw
LZMA's properties bytes and range coder reject early. A member stored uncompressed has no
decompressor to do that, so only the whole-stream checksum discriminates.

---

### SEC-15 — An encrypted member's stored digest may not be a digest of its plaintext

**Problem.** A format that encrypts member data has to decide what its integrity field
covers. If it stored a plain checksum of the plaintext, that value would be an oracle: it
lets an attacker confirm a guess about the content without the key. Formats therefore
transform the field — keying it, tweaking it with the derived key — so the stored value is a
message authentication code rather than a checksum. It looks exactly like a checksum field
and is not comparable to one.

**Symptom.** A tool that reads stored digests to identify content without decompressing gets
values that match nothing for encrypted members. A verification that compares the stored
value against a computed checksum of the decrypted bytes reports corruption on a perfectly
good archive.

**Evidence.** Measured in `dev-docs/investigations/rar-corpus-sweep-diagnosis.md:90-96`:
with the RAR5 tweaked-encryption flag set, the stored CRC32 and BLAKE2sp are key-tweaked
MACs, so the corpus assertion demanding a plaintext digest "demanded a digest the format
does not expose". Also `dev-docs/open-issues.md:228` (RAR5 HASHMAC / tweaked digests) and
`:227` (7z CRC-less encrypted store).

---

### SEC-16 — A password passed on a command line is visible to every process on the host

**Problem.** Delegating work to an external tool means passing it the password. Command-line
arguments are readable by any process on the machine through the process table, so a password
in an argument is disclosed for the lifetime of the subprocess. The tool's other channels —
standard input, an environment variable, a file — have different and not always documented
semantics.

**Symptom.** Reading an encrypted archive discloses its password to unrelated local
processes, with nothing in the calling code suggesting that happened.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/open-issues.md:230` ("RAR password via stdin (`-p` + stdin)"), closed
in the crypto round (`review/archive/2026-07-16-crypto/`, PR #127).

---

### SEC-17 — A key-derivation cost parameter in the archive is attacker-controlled

**Problem.** Encrypted formats store the work factor used to derive the key from the
password — an iteration count, or an exponent for one. The reader must use the stored value
to derive the same key, so the archive dictates how much computation the reader performs
before it can even attempt a decryption. A crafted archive can name a work factor large
enough to hang the reader, and the format's own maximum may be far above anything a real
writer uses.

**Symptom.** Opening a small encrypted archive consumes unbounded CPU before any data is
read, and cannot be interrupted meaningfully because the work is one key derivation.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/open-issues.md:229` ("7z `NumCyclesPower` ≤24 / `0x3F`"), closed in
the crypto round (`review/archive/2026-07-16-crypto/`, PR #127).

---

### SEC-18 — A native decompressor can loop forever on crafted input, and no host-language guard can stop it

**Problem.** Third-party native decoders can be driven into a busy loop by crafted input. A loop
inside a native thread cannot be converted into a host-language exception, cannot be interrupted
by a timer signal, and cannot be cleanly stopped by a test harness's timeout, because there is no
host-language frame to interrupt. Fuzzing that code from within the same process is therefore
impossible: the harness dies with it.

**Symptom.** Processing a hostile archive never returns and cannot be cancelled; the only remedy
available to the calling program is to have run it in a separate process it can kill.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:123-133`: the optional accelerators "can **busy-loop on
crafted input** — a hang no Python-level translator can convert into [a typed error], and one
that SIGALRM/pytest-timeout cannot cleanly interrupt (the loop is in a C++ thread)". Found by the
corpus mutation harness. The ISO library's infinite tree walk (UL-02) is the same shape in pure
Python and *was* fixable in-process.

---

### SEC-19 — A filename can display in a different order than it is stored

**Problem.** Unicode carries bidirectional formatting controls whose purpose is to reorder
the text that follows them. A name containing a right-to-left override displays, in every
listing a person reads, with its tail reversed: `evil\u202Egnp.exe` renders as
`evil<reversed>exe.png`, so an executable presents as an image. Nothing is escaped, nothing
is unwritable, and the bytes on disk are exactly the bytes in the archive — what is falsified
is the name a human reads back. The controls that do this are a specific set; three other
directional characters reorder nothing at all and occur in ordinary Arabic and Hebrew
filenames, so a blanket ban on "bidi characters" refuses legitimate names, and
right-to-left *script* carries no control character at all.

**Symptom.** A member's name reads as a harmless file type in every tool that lists it,
while being something else. A user who inspects an archive before extracting it is
inspecting a name the archive authored.

**Evidence.** Trojan Source, CVE-2021-42574. The set split is recorded in ADR
[`0017-bidi-override-rejection-is-policy-keyed`](../../dev-docs/decisions/0017-bidi-override-rejection-is-policy-keyed.md):
the **overrides and isolates** (U+202A–U+202E, U+2066–U+2069) reorder surrounding text and
are what the disguise needs; the **directional marks** (U+061C, U+200E, U+200F) reorder
nothing and appear in legitimate names. The ecosystem response is the same shape — `rustc`'s
`text_direction_codepoint_in_literal` and GCC's `-Wbidi-chars` are deny-by-default
diagnostics over the same ranges, not unconditional refusals.

### SEC-20 — A member name handed to an external tool is read by that tool as an option

**Problem.** Delegating to a command-line tool means putting an archive-supplied member name
into an argument list. Command-line conventions give leading characters meaning: a name
beginning with `-` is parsed as a switch, and one beginning with `@` is parsed by many tools
as "read the list of names from this local file". Both are attacker-chosen, since the name
comes from the archive. The end-of-options marker fixes the switch case only; there is no
convention that neutralizes the list-file prefix, and tools that accept glob metacharacters in
their include patterns often provide no escape for a literal one.

**Symptom.** Asking for one member's bytes returns a different member's bytes, or every
member's bytes, with the tool exiting successfully — so the wrong data arrives with no error.
Or the tool reads a local file the archive named, which is an arbitrary-file-read primitive
reachable by anyone who can hand over an archive.

**Evidence.** CWE-88 (argument injection). Confirmed end-to-end in
`review/archive/2026-07-16-rar-reader/SUMMARY.md` finding F3, against committed adversarial
fixtures (`tests/fixtures/rar/hostile_argv__.rar` and its RAR4 twin): a member named `-inul`
"parsed as a switch (drops the filter, emits **all** members' data — wrong-bytes confusion,
exit 0)", and a member named `@atfile` shown "driving `unrar` to read an attacker-named local
file". The review records explicitly that the end-of-options marker "fixes the switch case
but not `@`".

---

### SEC-21 — A variable-length integer's length is chosen by the input, so decoding it must be bounded independently of its value

**Problem.** Formats encode integers with continuation bits, so the field's length is part of
the data. An attacker therefore chooses how many continuation bytes to supply. If the decoder
accumulates by re-scanning or re-copying the bytes seen so far on each continuation, the cost
is quadratic in a length the input controls — and a few megabytes of continuation bytes burns
tens of seconds of CPU, with no allocation and no obviously malformed structure to reject.
Bounding the *value* does not help; the bound has to be on the number of bytes consumed.

**Symptom.** A small file makes the parser spin, using CPU rather than memory, before any
member exists. Nothing looks like corruption; the parser is simply working.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-16-rar-reader/SUMMARY.md` finding F2, confirmed
quadratic by a reproduction script: a header-size pre-read loop accumulating per continuation
byte, "a few-MB all-`0x80` input → tens of seconds CPU". The review notes the format's *other*
variable-length decoder was already capped at 11 bytes — this was a separate loop sitting in
front of it, which is why the existing bound did not cover it.

---

### SEC-22 — A declared size and a stored digest are both attacker-controlled, so neither bounds the output

**Problem.** A container records how big a member should be and what its checksum is. Both
values are in the archive, so an attacker sets both — and can set them consistently. A
member can therefore decode to far more than its declared size, and a check that only
compares the digest at the end delivers all of the excess before concluding anything; if the
digest was computed over the inflated content, it concludes nothing at all. Conversely a
length check alone accepts any content of the right size. The two checks bound different
things and neither substitutes for the other.

**Symptom.** Reading a member whose header declares ten kilobytes returns two hundred, with
no error. A caller who sized a buffer or a limit from the declared size is overrun by the
member it was protecting itself from.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-16-stream-decoder/SUMMARY.md` finding F6, verified:
"200 KB delivered for a declared 10 KB, no error" when the attacker matched the checksum to
the bloated content. The narrower field-range version of the same shape is in the same
review's F3b — a header field accepted up to 31 where the format's ceiling is 16, turning a
dictionary bound of 2¹⁶ into 2³¹.

---

### SEC-23 — A checksum over a header protects the parser from random mutation but not from an attacker

**Problem.** When a format checksums its own header, a randomly mutated header fails the
checksum and is rejected before the parser ever interprets its fields. That is good for
integrity and bad for testing: a mutation-based or coverage-guided fuzzer generates almost
exclusively inputs that die at the checksum, so the parser's hostile-input paths — the
allocation from a declared count, the length arithmetic, the bounds checks — are effectively
unreachable by random search. An attacker has no such difficulty: they recompute the checksum.
So the code paths most in need of fuzzing are the ones fuzzing reaches least.

**Symptom.** A fuzzing campaign reports high coverage and finds nothing, while a
hand-crafted header with a corrected checksum reaches a memory-exhausting allocation on the
first field it parses.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-12-codebase-deep-review/SUMMARY.md` finding 1: an
unbounded pre-allocation from a declared count, with the explicit note "**Fuzzers miss it
because it needs a valid-CRC crafted header**".

---

### SEC-24 — Without a password verifier, a wrong key is indistinguishable from damage, and any mechanism that needs the distinction fails

**Problem.** SEC-13 is about the wrong password producing a plausible result. This is the
other consequence of the same missing verifier: when decryption fails, there is nothing to
say *why*. The bytes are wrong, and "wrong key" and "damaged archive" are the same
observation. Anything built on telling them apart therefore silently does the wrong thing — a
loop that tries several candidate passwords and only continues on a key error stops on the
first candidate and never tries the rest; a prompt that re-asks only for a key error does not
re-ask.

**Symptom.** Supplying a list of candidate passwords to an archive whose format has no
verifier fails on the first wrong one, reporting corruption, and never tries the correct
password that was sitting in the list.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-16-rar-reader/SUMMARY.md` finding F1, confirmed by a
reproduction script: reported as corruption "whenever there is no usable password check
value — always for RAR3, and for any RAR5 whose `ENCRYPTION` block omits the check value",
which "escapes the password-candidate retry loop … so supplying `["wrong", "correct"]` …
aborts with [a corruption error] and **never tries the correct password**."

---

### SEC-25 — Path normalization is a filesystem question, not a string operation

**Problem.** Rewriting a member's path at read time — stripping a leading separator,
collapsing `..` segments — looks like a safe textual cleanup and is not. Collapsing
`foo/../bar` to `bar` is only equivalent when `foo` is a real directory; if `foo` is a
symbolic link, the two paths name different places, and an archive can plant that link in an
earlier member (SEC-02). So the collapse's correctness depends on filesystem state that does
not exist yet when the name is read. Two further consequences follow from normalizing at all:
the reported name is no longer what the archive stored, so a caller inspecting members before
extracting sees a sanitized path rather than the hostile one; and the safety check and the
destination computation end up looking at *different strings*, which must then be kept in
sync in two places.

**Symptom.** A member that should be refused is silently rewritten into an acceptable one, so
a listing shows innocent paths for an archive that is not. A traversal check on the rewritten
name passes while the danger lived in the value before the rewrite.

**Evidence.** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-03-minimal-name-normalization/proposal.md`:
"`/etc/passwd` becomes `etc/passwd` and `../../etc/passwd` becomes `etc/passwd`, emitting only
a warning", with the two named consequences — "`member.name` is not truthful" and "the safety
check and the path computation look at different strings" — and the symlink argument: the
collapse "is also only equivalent when `foo` is a real directory; if `foo` is a symlink
(planted by an earlier member) the two differ, so even 'internal' `..` collapse is a
filesystem-dependent decision read-time normalization cannot safely make."

---

### SEC-26 — The ratio guard's denominator is missing in exactly the configuration an attacker would choose

**Problem.** A compression-ratio limit needs to divide by something: either the member's own
compressed size or the archive's total input size. Neither is always available. A format
without per-member compressed sizes supplies the first as unknown; a source that cannot be
sized — a pipe, a socket — supplies the second as unknown. Both are unknown at once for a
compressed archive streamed from a pipe, which is precisely the shape an attacker sends:
unknown total size, enormous expansion. The ratio check then never activates and only the
absolute output cap remains, which still writes its whole budget from a few kilobytes of
input before tripping.

The ratio does not actually require a total. It can be measured *live*, from the compressed
bytes consumed so far against the uncompressed bytes written so far — a running figure that
exists even for a source whose total never will.

**Symptom.** The weakest configuration is the least protected: a bomb piped in gets to write
the full absolute limit — gigabytes — where a bomb in a file on disk is stopped almost
immediately. The difference is invisible to the caller, who set the same limits both times.

**Evidence.** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-04-live-decompression-ratio-guard/proposal.md`:
"When **both are unknown** … the ratio check never activates … That is the weakest
configuration and exactly the one an attacker picks: unknown total size, enormous expansion. A
2 GiB default cap still writes up to 2 GiB from a few KiB of input before tripping, whereas a
ratio guard would stop a 1000:1 bomb almost immediately."

---

### SEC-27 — Verifying that a terminator is present does not verify that nothing follows it

**Problem.** A format whose end is marked by a terminator gives a completeness check two
different jobs, and they are easy to confuse. Checking that the terminator *exists* proves the
archive was not cut short. It proves nothing about the bytes after it — appended junk, a
second archive concatenated on, an archive embedded in a larger file. A knob documented as
guaranteeing a complete listing therefore delivers only half of what its description promises,
and the missing half is the one that matters for "is this file exactly one archive?".

**Symptom.** A strictness setting turned on for provable completeness passes a file with
kilobytes of trailing data after the archive's end, and passes a pair of concatenated
archives while listing only the first one's members.

**Evidence.** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-08-09-strict-archive-eof-trailing-bytes/proposal.md`
with a measured table: the knob "actually checks … one thing: that the second 512-byte null
trailer block is present. It never looks past it." Independently confirmed in
`review/archive/2026-08-15-simplicity-consistency/SUMMARY.md` F20: "measured, it ignores 4 KiB
of appended junk."

---


## Platform & filesystem

### PLAT-01 — A byte source's own report of whether it can be repositioned is unreliable

**Problem.** Deciding whether a stream supports random access by asking it is not sound, in
several independent ways. A buffered wrapper answers for itself, not for the raw stream
underneath, and reports that it can seek over a source that cannot. A memory-mapped region
can be repositioned but, before a recent language version, offered no method to say so. Most
seriously, an operating-system pipe on Windows *lies*: its read end reports that it is
seekable, a seek call returns a plausible new offset, and the stream never actually moves —
a subsequent read returns bytes from the real, unmoved position, and a seek to the end
returns a fabricated size. The equivalent POSIX call fails cleanly, so the same code is
correct on one platform and silently wrong on the other. Probing by actually seeking is not
an answer either: it mutates a stream the caller may be mid-read on, and as the pipe case
shows, a successful probe proves nothing.

**Symptom.** Random-access reads return the wrong bytes, and sizes are fabricated, on one
platform only, with no error anywhere. Or a source that could have been read efficiently is
treated as forward-only.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:301-323`, with the Windows behaviour
confirmed on CI and pinned by `tests/test_stream_inputs.py:585`
(`test_windows_pipe_seek_characterization`). POSIX `lseek` on a FIFO fails with `ESPIPE`.
The resolution is a file-type check via `fstat`
(`src/archivey/internal/streams/streamtools/binaryio.py:96-107`).

A corollary constrains any fix: wrapping a non-repositionable source in a buffer to make it
repositionable makes the wrapper answer the capability question for itself rather than for the
stream underneath, so the caller is told something untrue about their source
(`2026-08-01-short-read-source-contract/design.md`).

---

### PLAT-02 — Resolving a path that loops raises an error the caller was not looking for

**Problem.** Asking the operating system to resolve a path that passes through a cycle of
symbolic links — `a` pointing at `b` pointing at `a` — fails, because it must: there is no
resolution. The failure surfaces as a low-level operating-system error on some platforms and
as a language-level runtime error on others, from a call whose documented job is "tell me
what this path really is". Code that treats resolution as infallible aborts.

**Symptom.** An archive containing a pair of mutually-referring links crashes the extraction
with an unhandled error rather than rejecting the member, taking down members that had
nothing to do with it.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:365-372` (`ELOOP` as `OSError`, "or
`RuntimeError` on some platforms/versions"); required adversarial-corpus case at
`history/SPEC.md:1141` ("cyclic symlinks (`a → b`, `b → a`) — verify extraction fails safe …
no uncaught `OSError`/crash").

---

### PLAT-03 — Hard links cannot always be created where the file is

**Problem.** A hard link and its target must live on the same filesystem; a destination that
spans a mount point, or a filesystem that does not implement links at all, refuses the
operation. Some filesystems refuse symbolic links too. The archive says "these two names are
one file", and the destination cannot express that.

**Symptom.** Extraction fails partway on an archive that is perfectly valid, on some
destinations and not others; or the two names end up as independent copies, which is a
different filesystem than the archive described.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:932` ("If hardlink creation fails (cross-device),
fall back to copying"); `history/COMPARISON.md:180` (cross-device fallback to copy);
`dev-docs/open-issues.md:236` ("Symlink-unsupported FS ≠ `tarfile` copy-through");
`dev-docs/IDEAS.md` §"Configurable symlink-extraction behavior", naming the platforms (FAT,
Windows without the privilege) and the established tool's silent copy-through.

---

### PLAT-04 — Extraction writes into a directory other processes can change underneath it

**Problem.** The destination of an extraction is ordinary shared filesystem state. Between
the moment a path is checked and the moment it is written, another process can replace a
directory with a link, create the file first, or delete a parent. No sequence of checks
performed by the extractor closes this, because the checks and the writes are separate
system calls.

**Symptom.** An extraction that validated every path writes somewhere else, or fails
inexplicably, when something else is touching the destination concurrently.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/open-issues.md:270` — recorded explicitly as out of scope:
"Concurrent hostile modification of the destination during extract".

---

### PLAT-05 — Extended file metadata has no portable representation

**Problem.** Beyond mode, owner and timestamps, filesystems carry metadata that archive
formats represent partially or not at all: extended attributes, access-control lists, macOS
resource forks, NTFS alternate data streams. A format may transport some of it in an
extension mechanism, and the destination filesystem may or may not have a place to put it.
Fidelity is therefore bounded by both ends independently.

**Symptom.** A round trip through an archive loses metadata silently — the files are there
and the attributes are not — and which attributes survive depends on the source format and
the destination filesystem.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:369-375` (C3: PAX extended attributes survive only
inside a format-specific extras mapping; ACLs, resource forks and NTFS alternate data
streams are untouched).

---

### PLAT-06 — Writing to a pipe whose reader has exited fails after the program's own code has finished

**Problem.** A program writing to a pipe gets an error when the reading end goes away — but
buffered output is flushed by the runtime *after* the program's main function returns, so the
error arrives outside any handler the program installed, and the runtime reports it as an
unhandled failure with a nonzero exit. The exception is also a subclass of the general
input/output error type, so a handler for the specific case placed after a handler for the
general one is unreachable code that looks correct.

**Symptom.** Piping a listing into a pager or `head` — the most ordinary thing a user does
with a listing — prints an error and exits nonzero, so a shell pipeline reports failure for a
successful command.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-17-cli/SUMMARY.md` finding F2: "piping `list` into
`head` exits 1 with `[Errno 32] Broken pipe` noise — the `except BrokenPipeError` handler is
dead code behind `except OSError`."

---

### PLAT-07 — How much space an extraction needs is not knowable, and how much is available is not stable

**Problem.** Failing an extraction partway leaves a half-written tree, so knowing in advance
whether it will fit is worth wanting. Neither side of the comparison is solid. The required
side comes from declared uncompressed sizes, which are absent for some formats, and are
attacker-controlled everywhere (SEC-22) — so a check built on them cannot be a safety control,
only a convenience against an honest mistake. The available side is worse than approximate: it
is racy and can be wrong in both directions. Transparent filesystem compression, sparse files,
reflinks and block-level deduplication all mean the written bytes may consume less than their
size; quotas and other writers mean the free figure moves between the check and the writes.
Replacing existing files also changes the *net* delta, which a sum of member sizes does not
model.

**Symptom.** An extraction dies partway with the disk full, leaving a partial tree the caller
has to clean up. Or a pre-flight check refuses an extraction that would have fit, or admits one
that does not.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/IDEAS.md` §"Opt-in free-space pre-flight for extraction", which
enumerates each reason it must be advisory: declared sizes "can be absent, wrong, or
adversarial"; free space is "**approximate and racy**: transparent FS compression (btrfs/zfs),
sparse files, reflink/dedupe, quotas, and other writers all move the target (TOCTOU)"; the
total is "unknowable" for a single-file compressor with no reliable stored size or a piped
archive; and overwrite changes the net delta.

---


## Upstream library defect

### UL-01 — A standard tar reader treats a corrupt header as a clean end of archive

**Problem.** The language's own tar reader validates header blocks, but only re-raises the
resulting error when the bad header is the *first* one in the file. A corrupt header
anywhere later is swallowed and iteration simply stops. Since a tar archive legitimately
ends when the headers stop, a reader built on it cannot distinguish "the archive ended here"
from "the archive is damaged here" — the library has already discarded the difference.

**Symptom.** A damaged archive lists successfully with fewer members than it contains. There
is no error, no warning, and no way for the caller to know that the listing is a prefix of
the truth. A verification tool reports the archive as sound.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/known-issues.md:7-33`, confirmed against both a corrupted-checksum
fixture and a corrupted compressed archive whose garbage decode parses as an invalid header
(deep review finding W1). The behaviour is in `tarfile.TarFile.next()`: the invalid-header
error is re-raised only at offset 0.

---

### UL-02 — An ISO reader loops forever on directory records that form a cycle

**Problem.** A widely used ISO 9660 library walks the image's directory tree with a plain
queue and no record of what it has already visited. A valid tree never revisits an extent,
so this is correct on valid input — but a corrupt or crafted image whose directory records
form a back-edge, a child extent pointing at an ancestor, makes the walk enqueue forever. It
affects every namespace the library walks. A single bit flip is enough to produce it.

**Symptom.** Opening a damaged disc image never returns and consumes memory until the
process dies. No exception is raised, so no error handling in the calling code runs — and a
timeout cannot distinguish this from a slow image.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/known-issues.md:35-50` and `dev-docs/threat-model.md:135-142`. Found
by the corpus mutation harness: a Joliet case at `bitflip@71746:0x01` on `basic-iso`, with
the same one-bit corruption in a subdirectory's extent reproducing on plain-only and
Rock-Ridge-only images. Pinning test `tests/test_iso.py:362`
(`test_pycdlib_directory_cycle_does_not_hang`), parametrized over all three namespaces.

---

### UL-03 — A native decompressor's worker threads outlive what the language can see

**Problem.** A high-performance decompressor implemented in C++ spawns its own worker
threads, invisible to the host language's threading machinery. It installs a guard that
terminates the process if a worker is still running when the interpreter begins finalizing.
Crucially, joining its threads is *not* enough to stop them — only closing the object is —
so an object that is garbage-collected, or merely dropped and reclaimed at interpreter exit
without being explicitly closed, aborts the process. This happens *after* all the work has
completed successfully.

**Symptom.** A program that decompressed everything correctly dies with an abort signal at
exit, printing a message about finalization from a running thread, or a heap error. The
crash has no relationship to the code executing at the time.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/known-issues.md:52-96` (Bug 1). Measured by
`tests/test_accelerator_shutdown.py` across cleanup strategies, each in its own subprocess:
explicitly closed → clean; reclaimed by the cyclic collector without closing → abort;
finalized at interpreter shutdown without closing → abort. The library's own message says to
close all objects.

---

### UL-04 — Two independent extensions bundling the same C++ core corrupt each other's heap

**Problem.** Two separately distributed native extensions by the same author statically bundle
a large overlapping C++ core. On macOS the dynamic loader coalesces their duplicate weak C++
symbols across the two shared libraries, so one module's allocator can free the other
module's objects. Importing both is harmless; *using* both in one process corrupts the heap.
Neither library documents this as a constraint, and the author's own guidance is to depend on
only one of them.

**Symptom.** A process that decompresses through both libraries aborts with a memory
allocator error about freeing an unallocated pointer, on macOS, essentially always — while
using either library alone, even with both imported, never fails. The crash site is
unrelated to either library.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/known-issues.md:98-129` (Bug 2). Isolated by
`scripts/dual_accelerator_repro.py` with no archivey and no pytest: ~100 % crash rate on
macOS with both, never with one. The upstream author's guidance is quoted verbatim from
`mxmlnkn/librapidarchive` ("if you need to use both, depend on rapidgzip for now").

---

### UL-05 — A native decompressor aborts the whole process when its Python callback raises

**Problem.** A native decompressor reading through a host-language file object calls back
into that object for bytes. If the callback raises — because the underlying stream was
closed, for instance — the C++ layer converts the failure into a C++ exception thrown across
a boundary that terminates on any exception, and the process aborts. This fires on read, on
close, and on garbage-collection-time finalization alike, so no host-language exception
handler anywhere can contain it: there is no frame to catch in.

**Symptom.** Closing a stream while decompression is still using it kills the process
outright, with no traceback and no chance for error translation. The equivalent
standard-library codec raises an ordinary catchable exception.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/known-issues.md:131-154` (Bug 3), present in the current and floor
version; the C++ layer throws `std::invalid_argument` ("Cannot convert nullptr Python object
to the requested result type") through a `terminate()` boundary. Also
`dev-docs/investigations/rapidgzip-upstream-report.md:68-82` §2, which records that some
*path*-source truncations and checksum mismatches can terminate during worker finalization
too.

---

### UL-06 — A parallel decompressor reports success on a truncated stream, by design

**Problem.** A decompressor optimized for random access decodes speculatively: it guesses
where compressed blocks begin and swallows the exceptions that guessing produces, because
they are expected. Reaching the end of the data is indistinguishable, inside that design,
from "no more decodable data here" — so a truncated stream yields either nothing or a
correct short prefix, and the read returns normally. The object's own completeness and size
attributes are set from what it decoded, so they agree with the short answer. There is no
flag that says the stream ended without a verified trailer, and this is deliberate rather
than a bug: the library's purpose is mid-stream random access, not integrity.

**Symptom.** Reading a truncated compressed file returns empty, or a plausible prefix,
without raising. A caller cannot distinguish that from a legitimately short file, and the
attributes it would consult to check agree with the wrong answer. The equivalent
standard-library decoder raises. The rate of silent-versus-raising varies by platform.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/investigations/rapidgzip-upstream-report.md:30-64`, with the upstream
code paths named (`ParallelGzipReader::read` returns bytes already written on a missing
chunk; `GzipChunkFetcher::processNextChunk` finalizes and returns empty; `GzipChunk::tryToDecode`
swallows `std::exception` while guessing block starts) and the explicit finding that
`block_offsets_complete` and `size` must not be trusted for completeness. Deliberately **not
filed upstream** — an incompleteness flag would be a feature request, not a bug report.
Also `dev-docs/known-issues.md:156-165`.

---

### UL-07 — A random-access index over a compressed stream does not record the stream's own boundaries

**Problem.** An index built for random access records seek points chosen for chunked
parallel decode. Those are not the boundaries of the compressed format's own members: a gzip
file may be several concatenated streams, and the index has no reason to record where one
ends. Nor does the library expose a count of them. So the index — the obvious place to look
for structure — cannot answer a structural question about the data it indexes.

**Symptom.** Determining whether a compressed file contains one member or several requires
scanning the bytes for another header, even though an index of the file is already in memory.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/known-issues.md:167-179`. Measured empirically on 2- and 3-member
files with distinct member sizes, read to end: member boundaries never appear in the offsets
at any parallelism setting — serial records only the start and end, parallel adds mid-member
chunk points unrelated to member starts. The index-import entry points are inputs, not a
decode-time enumeration. A change proposal to use the index for this was **closed on this
finding**.

---

### UL-08 — A native codec's worker thread can decode past the end of its input and write into freed memory

**Problem.** A codec binding runs its decoder on a native worker thread. A rewrite in one
release removed the worker loop's stop condition for exhausted input, and the binding
translates an unbounded output request into an effectively infinite symbol budget. For a
codec variant with no end-of-stream marker, the worker therefore decodes past the true end
of the data and, when its input runs out, is left blocked inside the reader rather than
finishing. Meanwhile the call that started it completes and frees the output block the
blocked worker still holds a raw pointer into. Any later wake — the next call, or teardown —
resumes the worker to write into freed memory.

The decisive detail is that a *bounded* request is not automatically safe: a request that
overshoots the stream's true remaining output by enough (measured at ≳64 KiB) reproduces the
crash with no unbounded call anywhere. The exact bound is what matters.

**Symptom.** Intermittent process aborts — segmentation faults, allocator errors, heap
corruption reports — during or after decoding valid, non-adversarial data. Crash rates
depend on allocator layout, so exercising other codecs first changes them, and the crash
often lands in unrelated code long after the corrupting write. A green test run can abort
at teardown.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/known-issues.md:199-419`, root-caused with valgrind: the
use-after-free is of the binding's own output buffer, freed at `_ppmdmodule.c:552`
(`OutputBuffer_Finish`) while the worker resumes at `ThreadDecoder.c:134`. Version matrix
under one identical stress scenario: 0/40 native crashes on 1.1.1 and 1.2.0, **12/40** on
1.3.1, pinning the regression to the threaded-decoder rewrite (upstream
`miurahr/pyppmd#126`). Minimal upstream-facing reproduction with no archivey
(`scripts/pyppmd_crash_repro.py`): ~40 % for one shape, 15–25 % for another, 0 % for the
controls. Overshoot A/B: +65 536 bytes over → 13/20 and 10/20; +64 and +4096 → 0/20 each.
Deterministic gate: `scripts/ppmd_uaf_valgrind.py`.

### UL-09 — Older releases of the same codec binding returned wrong bytes instead of crashing

**Problem.** The releases preceding the crash described in UL-08 had the stop condition the
rewrite removed, so their worker halted when input ran out — which prevented the runaway but
also cut symbols short at chunk boundaries. On a chunked bounded decode they therefore
returned *wrong output* and reported success. Pinning to an older release to avoid the crash
trades a loud failure for a silent one.

**Symptom.** Reading a member of a solid archive yields data that fails the container's
checksum, on the second and later members, with no crash and no diagnostic from the codec
itself.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/known-issues.md:278-311`: under one identical stress scenario,
1.1.1 and 1.2.0 produced 0/40 native crashes but 27/40 checksum mismatches on a solid
second member, while 1.3.1 produced 12/40 crashes and 0 mismatches.

---

### UL-10 — A codec can report end-of-stream early, making truncation indistinguishable from completion

**Problem.** A codec binding may flip its end-of-stream flag before the stream is actually
exhausted, when asked for a small amount of output over compressible data. A caller that
treats the flag as authoritative stops early and silently truncates valid data; a caller that
distrusts it and keeps draining to finish the tail can be pushed into an allocation failure
on the buggy release. Without knowing how many compressed bytes the member really has, the
two cases cannot be told apart at all.

**Symptom.** A chunked read of a valid member returns less than the member contains, or the
attempt to finish it exhausts memory. Which happens depends on the size of the reads the
caller chose.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/known-issues.md:477-483`: draining to finish the tail produced a
memory error in **36/36** trials at 50–99 % compressed-length cuts on the affected release.

---

### UL-11 — A zstd binding short-reads a truncated stream silently and cannot seek backwards

**Problem.** One widely used zstd binding returns a short read on a truncated stream without
raising, while two other bindings of the same codec raise on the same input; and its reader
cannot be repositioned backwards at all, refusing the operation with an
operating-system-level error. Separately, and independently of any binding, zstd's default
frame carries no integrity check, so corruption inside a frame is undetectable by any
reader.

**Symptom.** A truncated compressed file decodes to a short result that looks like success.
A backward seek fails outright, so serving one requires closing and reopening the stream and
decoding forward from the start. Corrupt-but-complete data decodes to garbage with no error
from any binding.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/library-analysis.md:102-116` — probed directly on one language
version with a 200 KB incompressible multi-block frame: truncation → silent short read for
one binding, `EOFError` for the two others; backward seek → refused for one, in-place rewind
for the two others; corruption with no frame checksum → silent for all three, "inherent to
zstd".

---

### UL-12 — Composing two raw filter stages in one library chain can silently drop the tail

**Problem.** A compression library that accepts a chain of raw filters can be asked to
combine an entropy coder with a branch-conversion filter. When the entropy coder's stream
lacks an end-of-stream marker — which is common from one widely used producer — combining
them in a single chain silently truncates the final look-ahead bytes the branch filter
needs. The library reports success; the last bytes of the member are simply wrong.

**Symptom.** A member decodes without error and its tail is corrupt. A checksum catches it
if the container stored one; nothing else does.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/library-analysis.md:282-290`, citing upstream BPO-21872 and the
xz-devel discussion, and noting that the same staging workaround is what another Python 7z
implementation does.

---

### UL-13 — The standard xz reader reports the wrong size for a multi-stream file

**Problem.** An xz file is a sequence of independent streams, optionally separated by
padding, each ending with a footer pointing back at an index of its own blocks' sizes. No
single index describes the whole file. A metadata path that reads only the last stream's
index therefore reports only the last stream's uncompressed size as the file's size. The
standard-library reader also cannot seek efficiently at all: any backward seek, including
seeking to the end to learn the size, re-decompresses the entire file.

**Symptom.** A multi-stream compressed file reports a size much smaller than it decompresses
to. Learning the size at all costs a full decompression.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/library-analysis.md:177-234` — the format's structural property
(footer → index → per-block compressed and uncompressed sizes) and the explicit record that
the previous standard-library-based metadata path "reported the wrong size for multi-stream
XZ files". The alternative third-party reader was rejected for requiring a seekable input
and doing an upfront full index scan.

---

### UL-14 — An encrypted-header writer may omit the digest that would make a wrong password detectable

**Problem.** Where a format's header-encryption has no password verifier (SEC-13), the one
deterministic check available is the stored digest of the encrypted header's own decoded
block — if the writer stored one. The reference implementation does; another widely used
writer does not, leaving the digest undefined. The archives most likely to be exercised in
testing are the ones the available writer produced, so the gap is invisible in a test suite
built on it.

**Symptom.** Wrong-password detection is deterministic on archives from one writer and
heuristic on archives from another, with nothing distinguishing them to the reader.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:190-197` (O8, defence 1): the reference writer stores
the digest so detection is deterministic; the other writer reports the digest as undefined on
the encoded-header block, "and the only 7z archives *we* produce are test fixtures written
through" it.

---

### UL-15 — A parallelism setting of zero means "all cores", not "sequential"

**Problem.** A native decompressor's parallelism parameter uses zero to mean "use every
available core" rather than "do not parallelize". A caller reading the parameter as a count
gets the opposite of what they intended, and the difference is invisible except in
throughput and thread count.

**Symptom.** Code that meant to disable parallel decode enables it maximally. Behaviour that
depends on parallelism — including which truncation cases go silent (UL-06) — differs from
what the caller reasoned about.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/investigations/rapidgzip-upstream-report.md:88-93`: "`parallelization=0`
→ `availableCores()`. Archivey passes `0` **intentionally** (all-cores + benchmarks). Not
'sequential.'"

---

### UL-16 — A finalizer that references its own subject can never run

**Problem.** A finalizer registered to clean up an object will not fire if its callback holds
a strong reference to that object: the registration keeps the callback alive, the callback
keeps the object alive, and the object therefore never becomes unreachable. The
registration succeeds, the code reads as a working safety net, and the cleanup simply never
happens. Nothing reports this.

**Symptom.** A resource the safety net was written to release leaks for the life of the
process. Collecting garbage explicitly does not help, because the object was never garbage.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/open-issues.md:88-95` — measured as +1 file descriptor on every one
of seven backends when a stream was dropped without closing, unchanged after three explicit
collections; root-caused to exactly this pattern, and fixed by capturing the object's
identity rather than the object.

---

### UL-17 — A library's tar and zip readers invalidate member streams when the archive is closed

**Problem.** The standard library's own archive readers invalidate any open member stream
when the archive object is closed. A library offering a different lifetime — streams remaining
usable after the archive closes — is more permissive, but contradicts what users migrating
from the standard library have learned, and makes an escaped stream survive silently where
they expect it to fail loudly.

**Symptom.** Code written against the standard library keeps working when it should have
failed, so a bug (a stream escaping its archive's scope) is not surfaced; or, if the
behaviour is matched, code that relied on the more permissive lifetime breaks with no notice
in a migration guide.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/open-issues.md:136-142`: `zipfile.ZipFile.close()` and
`tarfile.TarFile.close()` both invalidate member streams; measured on all seven backends,
reading after archive close succeeded everywhere before the change.

---

### UL-18 — Many native extensions in one long-lived process corrupt each other's heap

**Problem.** A process that loads a dozen independent native extension modules — codecs,
accelerators, cryptography, a subprocess-spawning wrapper — accumulates a shared heap that any of
them can damage. When one does, the failure surfaces at an arbitrary later allocation, so the
reported crash site is whatever ran next, not the offender. A component that merely allocates a
lot becomes the apparent culprit.

**Symptom.** A long-running process dies intermittently with a segmentation fault or an allocator
abort, at a site with no relationship to any archive work — during garbage collection, while
starting a subprocess, inside an unrelated library. The same run passes elsewhere. Removing
components changes the rate but not the shape, so the offender cannot be identified from the
crash.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/known-issues.md:530-709`, still open: crash sites listed with the
explicit note that the stack at death "is usually a **late symptom** (heap already corrupt), not
the corrupting call"; present with all optional extensions installed and clean with none;
typically absent on two other platforms on the same commits; and with no reliable single-command
reproduction. Also recorded: one combined test process aborted with every test green during
coverage flush.

---

### UL-19 — A capability the standard library provides only through a private function

**Problem.** A standard library sometimes implements exactly what a caller needs but exposes
it only as an undocumented private function. Using it works and is the only way to avoid
reimplementing the logic; it also means a future release can remove or change it with no
deprecation, and the removal is not a build error — it is an exception at run time, inside a
code path that is already handling data, where it looks like a data problem.

**Symptom.** After a routine language upgrade, every member using one codec reports the
archive as corrupt. The real cause is a missing private function, and nothing in the error
says so.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-12-codebase-deep-review/SUMMARY.md` finding 7:
"Private stdlib dependency `lzma._decode_filter_properties`: if a future Python drops it,
*every* LZMA 7z member silently reports [corruption] instead of failing loud."

---

### UL-20 — An upstream library reuses one broad built-in exception type for unrelated conditions

**Problem.** Libraries frequently raise a generic built-in exception for several unrelated
failures: a malformed archive, an argument that makes no sense, and an operation on an
already-closed handle can all arrive as the same type with only the message to tell them
apart. Any translation keyed on the exception type alone therefore has to pick one meaning
for all of them, and will be wrong for the others — and matching on the message text is
brittle across versions and locales.

**Symptom.** Closing a handle early, or making a programming mistake, is reported as a
corrupt archive — sending the caller to check the file, which is fine.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-08-15-simplicity-consistency/SUMMARY.md` finding F4:
"the ZIP translator maps **every** `ValueError` to corruption, and `"already closed"` falls
in. Sends a caller hunting a bad file that is fine." Related: F3 in the same review, where
argument-shape refusals raised at the entry point cannot be typed at all because they happen
before any translator is in scope, while the same refusal one path over is typed.

---

### UL-21 — A subcommand-style argument parser silently discards an option placed before the subcommand

**Problem.** Argument parsers with subcommands bind each option to whichever parser declares
it. An option declared only on a subparser is not recognized before the subcommand name — and
depending on the parser, it is not an error either: it is consumed as something else or left
unset. The generated usage text is produced from the declarations, so it can advertise the
placement that does not work.

**Symptom.** A command runs, succeeds, and ignores the option it was given: a password
argument placed before the verb does not decrypt, an instrumentation flag placed before the
verb reports nothing — and the help text shows exactly that spelling.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-17-cli/SUMMARY.md` finding F1: "every global flag
placed before the verb is silently discarded … and the `--help` usage line explicitly
advertises this placement", with the two concrete invocations that fail.

---

### UL-22 — The standard raw-stream base class is oriented the wrong way for a read-only wrapper

**Problem.** A language's raw byte-stream base class is written for the general case: it
assumes the implementer provides a fill-a-buffer primitive and derives the read-into-new-bytes
methods from it, and it answers "can this be read / written / repositioned?" with no by
default. Every read-only wrapper over an existing stream wants the opposite of all four —
it naturally implements read-into-new-bytes and delegates the rest, and it is readable,
not writable. So each wrapper carries the same six to eight overrides, and the interesting
method is one line among them. Worse, the fill-a-buffer primitive has genuinely subtle cases
— a non-blocking source returning nothing-yet rather than end-of-file, an underlying object
that does not implement it at all — so hand-written copies of it across a dozen wrappers
diverge, and the divergence is exactly where the subtle bugs live.

**Symptom.** A new wrapper is mostly boilerplate, and its author picks one of several
incompatible spellings of the buffer primitive already present in the codebase. Some of those
spellings handle the nothing-yet case and some do not, so behaviour on a non-blocking source
depends on which wrapper happens to be in the stack.

**Evidence.** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-06-27-stream-wrapper-base/proposal.md`, with an
inventory of ten wrappers and the two problems stated explicitly: the buffer primitive "is
implemented at least three different ways across these classes … (the non-blocking `None` case
is handled in some and not others)"; and "`io.RawIOBase`'s defaults are the wrong way round for
these wrappers … so every read-only wrapper must override `readable()→True`,
`writable()→False`, and provide a `readinto`."

A second-order consequence: the standard buffered wrapper *requires* the fill-a-buffer
primitive, so an object implementing only the read method cannot be buffered at all — which
bites test doubles written to the simpler shape, making a correct fix look broken
(`2026-08-01-short-read-source-contract/design.md`).

## Performance & memory

### PERF-01 — Streaming a solid archive with bounded memory and reading it member-by-member are different algorithms

**Problem.** Given that a solid block must be decoded from its start (FQ-06), there are two
ways to serve *n* members from it, and they have different costs in different resources.
Decoding the block once and handing out each member's bytes as the decompressor produces them
costs one pass and memory bounded by the decompressor's working set — but the members must be
consumed in order, and each stream is only valid until the next begins. Buffering the block
to memory or a temporary file lets members be read in any order and more than once, but costs
memory or disk proportional to the block. Neither dominates; the right one depends on what
the caller is doing, which the library cannot know.

**Symptom.** A conversion or hashing pass that reads every member once is either
memory-bounded or spills the largest block to disk, depending on a choice made for it. A
caller who reads members out of order finds the bounded design re-decoding, or finds the
buffered design's temporary files filling the disk.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/COMPARISON.md:159-173` compares the two designs directly:
one gives memory bounded by a queue "regardless of file/block size", the other O(largest
solid block) spilling to disk. The "two memory profiles" distinction — a monotonically
growing random-access cache versus a bounded sequential pass — is called out there as
something to state explicitly rather than leave implicit.

---

### PERF-02 — A backward seek in a compressed stream costs a full re-decode unless the format has an index

**Problem.** A compressed stream can only be read forwards: the decoder's state at offset *n*
is the result of everything before it. Repositioning backwards therefore means starting over,
unless the format records enough per-block information to restart mid-stream — which xz and
lzip do in an index or trailer, gzip and bzip2 do not, and zstd does only at frame
granularity, which for a single-frame file is one useless seek point at the start.

**Symptom.** A backward seek that looks like an ordinary cheap operation re-reads and
re-decodes the whole file, so an access pattern that seeks repeatedly is quadratic with no
error and no signal. Which streams are cheap to seek is a property of the format the caller
may not know they have.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/library-analysis.md:32-38` ("a codec with no native index services a
backward seek by re-decompressing from the start — O(n) per rewind … permitted but never
silent: the first rewinding seek logs a warning"), and the per-codec efficient-seek column at
`:46-60`. Frame-granularity limits of the zstd option at `:159-170`.

---

### PERF-03 — Verifying a member's declared checksum and delivering its bytes are the same read

**Problem.** A container that stores a digest per member lets a reader confirm that what it
delivered is what was stored. But the digest is over the whole member, so it can only be
checked once every byte has passed through — which is exactly the read the caller is already
performing. Treating verification as a separate step means reading the member twice, and on a
solid or compressed source the second read is a second decode.

**Symptom.** Verifying an archive costs twice what reading it costs, and on large members the
doubling is the dominant cost. Alternatively verification is skipped for speed, and
corruption is delivered silently.

**Evidence.** Named as the worked example of the neutrality rule in
[`brief.md`](brief.md):216 (§The neutrality rule). Verification is stated as a stage of the
uniform stream layer at `dev-docs/library-analysis.md:39-42`: the container-supplied digest
is checked over the decompressed bytes at clean end-of-file.

---

### PERF-04 — Recovering the readable prefix of a damaged stream and reporting the damage are in tension

**Problem.** When a compressed stream is cut short, the bytes before the cut are valid and
often wanted; the fact that it was cut is also wanted. A read that returns the prefix and
reports success is a lossy success — the caller cannot tell it got part of the data. A read
that raises and returns nothing is honest but throws away recoverable content. There is no
single answer, because the two callers (salvage a damaged backup; verify an archive) want
opposite things.

**Symptom.** Either a truncated file appears to read cleanly and short, or a truncated file
yields nothing at all even though most of it was intact. Both look like the library
misbehaving, from opposite directions.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/library-analysis.md:62-69` (note 1) and `:255-264`: a bounded read
returns the recoverable prefix and then raises on the next empty read, while a
read-everything call "raises [a truncation error] and returns nothing — a silent lossy
success is worse than not salvaging". The salvage use case is registered as unmet:
`dev-docs/open-issues.md:279` ("Salvage / best-effort read mode … all-or-error today").

---

### PERF-05 — Truncation is undetectable in formats that store no length or checksum

**Problem.** Detecting that a stream was cut short requires something to compare against: a
stored length, a checksum, or a defined terminator. Several compressed formats have none.
Brotli has no trailer at all. The classic Unix compress format has neither length nor
checksum, and its writers zero-pad after the last complete code — so a cut that happens to
leave only zero bits is byte-identical to a correctly terminated stream. A reader cannot
distinguish them because there is no difference in the bytes.

**Symptom.** Some truncations of the same file are reported and others are silent, with no
pattern the user can see. A verification pass gives a clean verdict on a damaged file.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/library-analysis.md` notes 2 and 3 (`:70-78`): brotli detected only
by "never finished at EOF"; `.Z` truncation is best-effort via nonzero leftover bits, and
"cuts that leave only zero leftover bits stay silent". Also `dev-docs/open-issues.md:265`
("`.Z` truncation: only nonzero leftover bits are loud").

---

### PERF-06 — Decoding is CPU-bound native work, so concurrency buys overlap and not throughput

**Problem.** Every decompressor available to this kind of library is native code that holds
the interpreter's global lock or releases it around a CPU-bound loop. Running more of them
concurrently in one process therefore does not multiply throughput the way independent I/O
would; what concurrency buys is overlapping a slow source with decode, and not blocking a
caller's event loop. Adding more concurrent decoders also adds file descriptors, memory and
native threads, so past a point it costs more than it returns.

**Symptom.** A parallelized read of an archive is no faster than the sequential one, or
slower, while using several times the memory and descriptors. Speedups measured on one shape
of archive do not appear on another.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/ASYNC.md:70-77`: "async buys **no CPU concurrency** — decode
is CPU-bound under the GIL. The only win is **I/O overlap**."
`dev-docs/investigations/parallel-reader.md:131-137`: a consumer "must not assume more
accelerator objects ⇒ linear speedup (FD / memory / thread pressure)". Per-format
parallelizable units and their constraints at `parallel-reader.md:141-154`; workloads
including a deliberate negative control at `:83-97`.

---

### PERF-07 — Bounding decode work by input size does not bound memory, because the ratio is unbounded

**Problem.** A streaming decoder has to choose how much to do per call, and the natural
choice is a fixed amount of *compressed* input. But the expansion ratio is unbounded
(SEC-03), so a fixed compressed increment produces an unbounded decompressed one. A caller
asking for a single byte can therefore cause tens of megabytes to be produced and held. This
is not specific to hostile data — ordinary highly-redundant content does it — and it is a
property of the granularity choice, not of any codec.

**Symptom.** Reading one byte from a small compressed file consumes tens of megabytes.
Per-member limits do not fire, because nothing has been extracted yet: the memory is inside
the decoder's buffer.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-16-stream-decoder/SUMMARY.md` finding F3, measured and
re-verified across codecs on a `read(1)`: brotli **80 B → 50 MB**, xz 7.4 KB → 50 MB,
deflate 48 KB → 50 MB, LZW 9.4 KB → 20 MB. The review records that maintainer review
correctly broadened it from one codec to the shared base, and that forward iteration applies
no extraction-time guard.

---

### PERF-08 — Bounded memory and per-call overhead pull against each other, and the boundary crossing dominates

**Problem.** A native codec's cost has a fixed component per call — crossing the language
boundary, setting up and tearing down the call — and a variable component per byte. Feeding
it in small increments to keep memory bounded (PERF-07) pays the fixed cost once per
increment, while a whole-member call pays it once. On small-to-medium members the fixed cost
dominates, so a streaming layer can be materially slower than a whole-member call for reasons
that have nothing to do with the compression algorithm.

**Symptom.** A library that adds no algorithmic work is measurably slower than a
whole-member call on the same data, and the gap does not respond to removing wrapper layers —
which is where anyone would look first.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-28-performance/SUMMARY.md` §Post-merge update: removing
wrapper layers "did not move" the read-all wall time (±2 %, within noise, on two independent
probes), and the real cost was decode granularity — an 8 KiB compressed feed "through a
5-frame Python loop ~17×/member while `zipfile` decompresses each member in a single C call".
Raising the feed took read-all from **1.38× → 1.23×** of the standard library on that host.

---

### PERF-09 — A performance guard measures a quantity, and a regression can change a different one

**Problem.** Guarding a performance property requires choosing what to count, and the choice
decides which regressions are visible. Counting bytes *delivered* cannot see redundant
decoding, because the redundant work produces no extra output — a change that decodes
everything twice and delivers it once is invisible on that axis. A tolerance wide enough to
absorb run-to-run noise on a shared machine is also wide enough to absorb a real regression.
And a comparison against a peer implementation only exists for the operations someone thought
to write a peer for; the others are unguarded regardless of how the guard is tuned.

**Symptom.** A guard reports green while the behaviour it exists to protect has regressed,
and the property is instead maintained by documentation. Alternatively the guard is tuned
tight enough to catch regressions and fails constantly on machine noise.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-28-performance/SUMMARY.md`, three findings marked
blocker: wall-time ratios "asserted nowhere" with the only hard check a sanity ceiling and
the real band an informational print (P1); a decode-twice-deliver-once regression **passing**
the guard because the byte axis counts delivered output and the seek tolerance absorbed the
churn (P4); and a full double re-decode of a solid block passing because the bound was set at
exactly a factor of two (P5). Also P6: no peer implementation existed for open, list or
extract at all, "why P2's extract miss went unnoticed".

---

### PERF-10 — At scale, the cost of an archive is dominated by opening it, not by decoding it

**Problem.** A workload over very many small archives — indexing a backup tree, deduplicating
a corpus — pays the per-archive fixed cost once per file and the per-byte cost barely at all.
That fixed cost is format detection, index parsing, and constructing a metadata object per
member: sub-millisecond individually, minutes across a million archives. Throughput
benchmarks, which use large archives to make the per-byte cost measurable, are precisely the
shape that hides it.

**Symptom.** A sweep over a large number of small archives takes far longer than the total
bytes suggest, while every throughput measurement looks healthy.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-28-performance/SUMMARY.md` finding P7: per-open
**5–8×** the standard library, attributed to "detection + member-model build ~0.3 ms/archive
— the founding million-archive sweep pays minutes". The same review's P2 records open-and-list
at 5–8× against 2.2–2.3× for reading.

---

### PERF-11 — Whether a backward seek is expensive depends on the distance to a restart point, not on the codec

**Problem.** Formats that can carry a restart index often carry a degenerate one. A single
compressed block — which is what the default compressor settings produce — yields exactly one
restart point, at the origin, so every backward seek re-decodes the whole stream. The file is
in an indexable format and has an index; the index is just useless. Any predicate keyed on
*which format or codec* this is therefore gets the answer wrong for the commonest files of
that format, in the quiet direction: it reports the seek as cheap because the format supports
indexing.

**Symptom.** Backward seeks in an ordinary single-block file re-decode from the start with
nothing reported, so an advisory meant to warn about exactly that cost is silent precisely
where the cost is highest — and a caller who escalated that advisory to an error to catch the
pattern never sees it fire.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-08-15-simplicity-consistency/SUMMARY.md` finding F19,
which the review notes its own probe could not have found and which surfaced only by working a
question the maintainer reopened against the review's recommendation: "a single-block `.xz`
(what `lzma.compress` and un-threaded `xz` produce) has one seek point at the origin,
re-decodes the whole stream on a backward seek, and emits nothing — so [escalating the
advisory to an error] cannot fire either. The honest predicate is the seek's re-decode
distance".

---

### PERF-12 — Reusing a decoder across accesses and serving concurrent accesses pull against each other on a solid block

**Problem.** FQ-06 is that a solid block must be decoded from its start. This is the part that
is a *choice* rather than a consequence. If the decoder is discarded after each access, then
every access starts over, and in-order access costs exactly as much as reverse order — so what
looks like a solid-format penalty is really a no-reuse penalty, and a format that happens to
hold its stream open pays nothing for the same in-order walk. If instead one decoder is held and
reused when the next request is at or ahead of its position, in-order walking becomes a single
pass.

But that is only simple while one access is live at a time. Serving two accesses into one solid
block concurrently requires two decoder states, each with its own dictionary, each decoding
from the block's start — so concurrency multiplies exactly the work reuse was introduced to
avoid, and there is no configuration that gives both. Deciding what to keep when those accesses
finish is a cache-design question (how many, which one, evicted how, owned by what, torn down
when) that the single-access version does not have.

**Symptom.** Walking every member of a solid archive by name costs several times a single
sequential pass, and reversing the order changes nothing — which rules out "backward seeks are
expensive" as the explanation. Meanwhile allowing two concurrent reads of one solid block
silently doubles the bytes decompressed.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/IDEAS.md` §"Hold the solid-block decoder open across `open()` calls",
both halves measured. The cost: on a single-folder solid 7z, "walking every member via `open()`
costs **4.5× one pass** — and, because the underlying stream is not held, **in-order and reverse
order cost the same**; this is not a backward-seek problem, it is a no-reuse problem", against a
compressed tar which "*does* hold its stream" and "costs 1.0× in order". The concurrency half,
on a 6-member single-folder solid 7z with a 1.2 MB payload: opening members 1 and 4
simultaneously reports **1 400 000** bytes decompressed — "400 KB + 1 000 KB, i.e. **two
independent decodes, each from the folder's start, live at the same time**".

---


## API and usage pattern

### API-01 — A caller who asks for random access over a forward-only source can be served silently or refused

**Problem.** Random access over a source that cannot be repositioned is only possible by
buffering the source — to memory or to disk — for as long as the archive is open. That cost
is proportional to the whole archive regardless of how little of it the caller wanted, and it
is invisible: the operation succeeds, and the resource consumption appears somewhere else.
The alternative is to refuse, which is honest but makes the caller handle a case they may not
have known existed.

**Symptom.** Either an unremarkable-looking open consumes memory or disk proportional to a
stream the caller was treating as streamed, or a program that works on a file fails on a pipe
with an error about seekability.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:911` (a non-seekable source for an
index-at-the-end format raises at open time, "the library does **not** implicitly buffer");
decided in ADR
[`0010-no-silent-buffer-nonseekable`](../../dev-docs/decisions/0010-no-silent-buffer-nonseekable.md);
`dev-docs/open-issues.md:252` (§Irreducible, "no silent buffer").

---

### API-02 — "Unknown" and "empty" are different answers that formats force into one field

**Problem.** For most metadata a format either records a value or does not: no mode, no
timestamp, no size, no digest. Zero, the empty string and the epoch are all legal *values*
for those fields too. Collapsing the two cases — substituting a default for a missing value —
destroys information the caller needs, and raising instead of answering makes ordinary
listing fail on ordinary archives.

**Symptom.** Every member appears to have been modified at the epoch, or to be mode 0, or to
be size 0, and the caller cannot tell which of those are real. A conversion writes those
substituted values into the target archive as if they had been recorded.

**Evidence.** Stated as a design authority at `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:13`: "when a format
quirk cannot be cleanly mapped to the unified model, the library surfaces the inconsistency
as an explicit, documented field value (`None` or an `Unknown` sentinel) — never as a silent
guess, default, or exception." Per-field consequences at `SPEC.md:368,905,972`.

---

### API-03 — Handing a caller a metadata object before the data is read forces a choice about mutation

**Problem.** Given that some fields are only knowable after the data is read (FQ-01, FQ-03),
a library that yields a metadata object first has three options and no fourth: mutate the
object the caller holds when the values arrive; hand back a replacement, which the caller
must know to re-fetch; or refuse to yield anything until the data is read, which defeats
streaming. Mutation makes the object unusable as a dictionary key or set member and means
two things can write to it. A replacement cannot be delivered at all in a single forward pass,
where there is nothing to re-fetch from.

**Symptom.** Either the object a caller stored changes underneath them, or it silently never
gains the late values, or they cannot put members in a set. A filter that edits a member
either loses the late values or corrupts the library's bookkeeping.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:73-101` and `:229-243`, which state the
mechanism and the reason a transform cannot live in the yielding generator: a copy-returning
filter "would yield that copy while the backend went on updating the original — the caller's
object would never see the late values". Decided in ADR
[`0007-mutable-archive-member`](../../dev-docs/decisions/0007-mutable-archive-member.md).

---

### API-04 — The cost of an operation varies by orders of magnitude across formats that share one interface

**Problem.** "List the members" is instant on a format with an index and a full decompression
on one without (FQ-05); "read this member" is direct on one layout and a re-decode of
everything before it on another (FQ-06); "seek backwards" is cheap with an index and a full
re-decode without (PERF-02). A uniform interface over these formats necessarily makes
operations with wildly different costs look identical at the call site. Worse, the cheap path
often exists but is reachable only by knowing which knob turns it on, which means the cost
model is expressed as configuration flags rather than as an answerable question.

**Symptom.** A caller writes the obvious loop and it is quadratic on one format and linear on
another, with nothing at the call site to suggest a difference. To get the cheap behaviour
they must already know it exists — the flag is the documentation.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/COMPARISON.md:188-190`: the backend flags' "weakness … is
that backend flags … leak the cost model: you must know the trick to get cheap seeking on
`.tar.gz`." The three orthogonal cost axes and their per-format values at
`history/ARCHITECTURE.md:508-541`.

---

### API-05 — Access mode is a real binary, but three-valued models of it are tempting and wrong

**Problem.** A caller either needs to reach any member at any time or is going to make one
forward pass. Those are different requirements with different feasible sources, so the choice
has to be made before the archive is opened. An "automatic" third value looks attractive but
cannot deliver: nothing at open time reveals what the caller will do next, so "auto" is
either a guess or just another mode. What *is* genuinely separate is a performance hint —
build seek points eagerly — which is not an access requirement at all.

**Symptom.** A three-valued setting where one value does not do what its name says, and
callers choosing it get one of the other two behaviours arbitrarily.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/COMPARISON.md:9-20`: an enum was recommended and then
**reversed** during the build — "`AUTO` does not actually auto-select (it is just another
mode), and the model collapses to a real binary — random access vs. forward-only — plus a
deferred performance hint." Decided in ADR
[`0004-streaming-bool-not-intent-enum`](../../dev-docs/decisions/0004-streaming-bool-not-intent-enum.md).

---

### API-06 — A forward-only pass can be run once, and callers will try to run it twice

**Problem.** A single forward pass over a stream consumes it. Anything that would need to see
a member again — listing after iterating, iterating twice, extracting after listing — is not
available, and the reason is the source, not the interface. Meanwhile an interrupted pass
leaves the source somewhere in the middle, which is neither "not started" nor "finished". A
caller who breaks out of a loop early and then asks a question about the archive is asking
about a stream that no longer starts where they think.

**Symptom.** The second iteration of an archive yields nothing, or a listing after a partial
read is silently short, and the same code works on a file and fails on a pipe.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:250-273` (the one-pass rule, the operations it
covers, and the deliberate absence of replay from cache because link-resolution semantics
differ at yield time and after finalization); `dev-docs/open-issues.md:251` (§Irreducible,
"Streaming mode is one pass (including after early `break`)").

---

### API-07 — A programming mistake and a bad archive need to be distinguishable by type

**Problem.** Two unrelated kinds of failure arise at the same call sites: the input is
damaged, encrypted, truncated or uses an unsupported feature — and the caller used the API
wrongly, by asking for random access on a forward-only reader, passing a member from a
different archive, or setting contradictory arguments. A caller writing a robust tool wants to
catch the first kind and let the second kind crash, because the second is a bug in their own
code. If both are the same type, `except` swallows their bugs.

**Symptom.** A broad exception handler around archive work hides the caller's own logic
errors, so a misuse presents as "this archive is bad" and is diagnosed as a data problem for
as long as it takes someone to read the traceback.

**Evidence.** Decided in ADR
[`0012-usage-errors-outside-archiveyerror`](../../dev-docs/decisions/0012-usage-errors-outside-archiveyerror.md);
the error-contract convention is restated in `review/README.md` §Conventions ("usage errors
sit deliberately outside the tree"). Taxonomy at `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:642-694`.

---

### API-08 — Errors from a dozen libraries must be comparable without erasing their origin

**Problem.** Every codec and container library has its own exception taxonomy, and a library
that composes them presents callers with a dozen unrelated hierarchies for the same handful of
real conditions — corrupt data, truncated data, wrong password, unsupported feature.
Translating them into one taxonomy makes callers' code possible, but a translation that
catches broadly also swallows genuinely unrelated failures — filesystem errors, interrupts,
memory exhaustion — and one that discards the original loses the only precise diagnostic
information there was.

**Symptom.** Either callers must catch several libraries' exception types (and learn which
libraries are in use, which is a packaging detail), or an interrupt or a disk error is
reported as a corrupt archive and the original traceback is gone.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:460-506`: translation is per-library, context
is stamped centrally, the original is attached as the cause, and "genuine non-decoding errors
propagate unchanged" — a filesystem error, an interrupt, and a memory error must not become
archive errors. `history/SPEC.md:692` ("Libraries must never swallow the original
exception").

---

### API-09 — Advisory conditions are numerous, and logging is the wrong channel for a library

**Problem.** Reading real archives produces a steady stream of things worth saying that are
not failures: a name was normalized, an extension disagreed with the content, a digest was
absent, a rewinding seek was expensive, a trailer was missing. A library cannot decide what to
do with these. Emitting them as log records makes them unavailable to a caller that wants to
act on them programmatically and configures a logger it does not own; raising them makes
ordinary archives fail; returning them as values requires deciding *when* — an advisory about
a member is meaningless before the member exists, and one about the whole archive is
meaningless after it is closed.

**Symptom.** A caller who wants to know whether anything was odd about an archive has to
parse log text, or install a log handler and correlate records with operations, or accept that
the information is only visible to a human reading a terminal.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:361-368` (C2, "Warnings that should be data"),
addressed by the lifecycle-aware diagnostics capability. The lifecycle constraint (which
surface an advisory can attach to) is what made this non-trivial, discussed at length in
`dev-docs/discussions/2026-08-diagnostics/`.

---

### API-10 — Asynchronous decoding is not available at all in this language, whatever the interface says

**Problem.** Every decoder is synchronous native code that pulls its input through a blocking
read callback the caller does not control. There is no hook to make a decompression call await
its next input chunk, and a native stack frame cannot be suspended on an await. So an
"asynchronous archive library" is not a thing that can exist here: the middle of the pipeline
is unavoidably synchronous, and the only places asynchrony can live are the two edges — bytes
arriving from a slow source, and bytes leaving to a slow consumer. An interface written
asynchronously all the way down would still run the decode on a worker thread, and would have
paid the cost of colouring every layer to reach a ceiling the edges already reach.

**Symptom.** An asynchronous interface over blocking decoders gives the appearance of
asynchrony with none of the benefit, and every function it touches becomes callable only from
other asynchronous functions — the parallel-universe duplication that makes the choice hard to
reverse.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/ASYNC.md:50-82`: the named blocking call sites in each decode
path (`zipfile` reading `self.fp.read(n)` synchronously inside its member reader; `tarfile`
walking headers synchronously; the pull-driven standard-library codecs; a subprocess pipe read
synchronously) and the conclusion that "there is no 'async all the way down' available in
Python without rewriting the decoders". Cost comparison of the three options at `:115-154`.

---

### API-11 — Appending to an archive in place is possible for some formats and unsafe in all of them

**Problem.** Some formats technically permit appending: a ZIP can gain a new central
directory at the end, a tar can be concatenated. But an append interrupted partway leaves a
file that is neither the old archive nor the new one, and a concatenated tar is not a valid
single archive by every reader's reading. Other formats have no append mode at all. So the
operation is available unevenly, and where available it converts a crash into a corrupted
archive.

**Symptom.** A tool that appends produces archives that some readers accept and others
reject, and an interrupted append destroys data that existed before it started.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:807-812`: ZIP append "is fragile and creates
corrupt archives if interrupted. 7z has no append mode. TAR can be appended to … but the
result is not a valid multi-stream archive."

---

### API-12 — Requiring pre-fetched members for a one-shot call forces the caller to open the archive twice

**Problem.** A convenience function that does the whole job in one call — open, read, extract,
close — cannot also accept a list of members to select, because obtaining that list requires
having opened the archive already. A caller with a selector in hand must open, list, close, and
then call the one-shot function, which opens again. The selection and the one-shot shape are
mutually exclusive by construction.

**Symptom.** The convenient function grows a parameter that can only be used by first doing
the thing the function exists to avoid, and callers write the open-list-close-reopen
anti-pattern because the signature invited it.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/SPEC.md:55-59`: "There is deliberately no `members=` selector:
passing pre-fetched members to a one-shot function would force the caller to open the archive,
fetch the list, and reopen it here (an anti-pattern)."

---

### API-13 — An explicit argument that is silently ignored is worse than one that is rejected

**Problem.** When a caller passes an explicit override, they are asserting something. If some
other property of the input takes precedence, the assertion is discarded — and the plausible
route to that situation is a variable holding what the caller *believes* is a path to an
archive, which is exactly the case where a quiet reinterpretation is least welcome.

**Symptom.** A call with an explicit format override behaves as though the argument were not
passed, with no error and no warning, only when the input is of the one kind that overrides
it.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/open-issues.md:162-187` (P8): a directory path resolved its own format
before the caller's argument was ever consulted, "so the argument is discarded without a
diagnostic … every other way of being explicit about the format is honoured or rejected
loudly."

---

### API-14 — Laziness has to be honoured all the way down or it is not laziness

**Problem.** An interface that yields members and opens each one's data only if the caller
asks promises that unselected members cost nothing. A backend that opens the underlying
resource at yield time, or starts the whole decode when the pass begins, satisfies the shape
of the interface and not the promise. The difference is invisible until the archive is
encrypted, at which point starting the decode demands a password for data nobody asked for —
and a wrong password then appears to be accepted, because the failure happens where no one is
looking.

**Symptom.** Iterating an encrypted archive without reading any member fails asking for a
password, or accepts a wrong one. Iterating an archive to look at names does the work of
reading it.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/open-issues.md:239`: the requirement was already specified —
"unselected/unread members are not opened/decompressed **and do not request passwords**" — and
"7z opened each folder at yield time and solid RAR spawned `unrar` at pass start, so iterating
an encrypted archive without reading raised `EncryptionError` and made a wrong password look
right". Found by review; fixed in `#225`.

---

### API-15 — A capability that is cheap on one format and a trap on another cannot be on by default

**Problem.** Seeking inside a member and opening two members at once are both free on a
format with independent per-member offsets and both hazardous elsewhere: on a single
compressed stream a backward seek re-decodes (PERF-02), on a solid layout an out-of-order
open re-decodes a whole block (FQ-06), and on a shared handle two concurrent readers corrupt
each other (CONC-01). Offering them unconditionally means a developer can write and test
their code against the cheap format, see it work, and ship a footgun that fires on a format
they never tried. Publishing the cost as a queryable property (API-04) does not prevent this,
because nothing forces anyone to query it.

**Symptom.** Code validated against one archive format degrades to quadratic, or returns
wrong bytes, on another — in production, on a user's archive, with no error at development
time.

**Evidence.** Stated as the context of ADR
[`0003-member-streams-opt-in`](../../dev-docs/decisions/0003-member-streams-opt-in.md): "an
unconditional 'always seekable / always concurrent' API lets developers test on ZIP and ship
a footgun on TAR/7z. Cost receipts alone are too passive."

---

### API-16 — A verdict delivered at close is delivered where nobody can act on it

**Problem.** An integrity check over a member can only conclude once every byte has passed
through (PERF-03), which makes the closing call the tempting place to report it. But closing
happens in scope-exit and cleanup blocks, where raising displaces whatever exception was
already propagating — so the report arrives by destroying the diagnostic it arrived with. And
a caller who deliberately stopped reading early never asked for a verdict at all; failing
their cleanup for a check they did not request is wrong. Meanwhile the read itself has an
ambiguity of its own: if a short return can mean either "healthy data, ask again" or "this is
the end", then no single read result is a conclusion, and a caller cannot tell a complete
short member from a truncated one.

**Symptom.** An integrity failure surfaces as an exception from a cleanup block, masking the
real error, or from a scope exit after the caller has already handled what they thought was
the outcome. Or a truncated member reads as a series of short-but-successful reads that never
resolve into a verdict.

**Evidence.** ADR
[`0014-integrity-verdicts-from-reads-not-close`](../../dev-docs/decisions/0014-integrity-verdicts-from-reads-not-close.md):
"`close()` runs in `__exit__` and in `finally` blocks, where raising masks the original
exception, and a caller who stops reading early has not asked for a verdict at all." The
trade-off analysis and rejected alternatives are in
`dev-docs/investigations/adr-0014-investigation.md`.

---

### API-17 — Verifying a whole-member digest requires consuming every byte in order, which any seek destroys

**Problem.** A digest over a member can only be computed incrementally by hashing each byte as
it passes, in order. A seek inside the member breaks that: bytes are skipped, so the running
hash no longer corresponds to any prefix of the member, and it cannot be repaired by seeking
back — resuming the hash over a non-contiguous range would produce a mismatch that means
nothing. So an interface offering both intra-member seeking and integrity verification cannot
offer them together on the same handle, and must decide which is forfeited.

The structural half of the verdict has a subtler version of the same problem. Whether a member
was complete can be judged from how far reading got — but a seek moves the logical position
without reading, so a complete member whose tail the caller skipped and a genuinely truncated
member both end with the read position short of the declared size. The two are
indistinguishable from position alone, and guessing either way is wrong in one direction:
fabricating a clean end silences a real truncation, and raising on the lagging position invents
a truncation for a caller who deliberately skipped ahead.

**Symptom.** A checksum failure reported on a perfectly good member, because the caller
seeked; or a truncated member reported as complete, because the caller seeked past the end and
the read returned empty as it would for any file. The idiom "seek to the declared size, read
one byte" gives the wrong answer in at least one of the three cases it is used to distinguish.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/investigations/adr-0014-investigation.md:228-277`: a seek off the
sequential frontier "breaks *incremental hashing* (non-linear consumption)", and a
seek-forward-then-back "must not re-enable a hash comparison over a non-contiguous byte range
(false-positive [corruption verdict])"; and the past-end case cuts both ways because in-memory and
ordinary file objects permit seeking past the end.

---

### API-18 — A stream type that needs methods a plain file object lacks is not substitutable

**Problem.** Byte streams are the interoperation currency of a language's ecosystem: a
consumer accepts "a file-like object" and a producer returns one. A stream type that requires
callers to use a method ordinary file objects do not have breaks substitution in both
directions — code written against it cannot be handed a plain file, and the stream cannot be
handed to a third-party consumer that only knows the standard protocol. So a convenience
method that would fix a real ambiguity in the standard protocol (such as the sized-read
shortfall of API-16) costs more than the ambiguity does.

**Symptom.** A stream cannot be passed to an existing consumer, or code that works on a
returned stream fails when the same code is pointed at an ordinary open file — the abstraction
leaks at exactly the boundary it was supposed to hide.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/investigations/adr-0014-investigation.md:295-305`, rejecting a
read-exact method on precisely these grounds: "A core goal is that code written against
archivey streams also works against ordinary file objects (and vice versa), so we do **not**
add methods a plain `BinaryIO` lacks."

---

### API-19 — Two standard ways of reading the same stream must reach the same verdict

**Problem.** A byte-stream protocol offers several read idioms — read a fixed count, read
everything, iterate until empty — and callers use all of them interchangeably. A failure
discovered at the end of the data has to be reported through whichever idiom the caller
chose. Deferring it to "the next read" works for the chunked idiom and is invisible to the
read-everything idiom, which never issues a next read: it returns what it has and the error
is dropped. The same bytes then produce a clean short result one way and an error the other.

**Symptom.** A truncated file read with the one-line read-everything idiom succeeds with
partial data; the identical file read in a loop raises. Whether damage is detected depends on
how the caller happened to spell the read.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-16-stream-decoder/SUMMARY.md` finding F4:
"`read(-1)`/`readall()` never consult [the deferred error], so a truncated `.Z` read with
the `f.read()` idiom returns partial data and **swallows** the [truncation error] that the
*same input* raises when read in chunks." The review notes the root cause is in the shared base,
not the one codec that exposed it. The false-EOF twin is
`review/archive/2026-07-19-stream-layering/SUMMARY.md` F1, where a zero-length read was
treated as end-of-file and produced a spurious corruption error.

---

### API-20 — Declaring an intention about access should not change the metadata reported

**Problem.** A format's cheap metadata often lives in the same structure as its restart
index: a trailer carrying both the uncompressed length and a checksum, an index footer
carrying per-block sizes. If that structure is read only as part of building a seek index,
then whether the caller asked to seek decides whether the length and checksum are known. Two
unrelated things — what I intend to do with this stream, and what this stream's metadata is —
become coupled. The same coupling appears between source shapes: a path and an in-memory
seekable stream carry identical information, so metadata that appears for one and not the
other is reporting the plumbing rather than the archive.

**Symptom.** The same archive reports a member's size as unknown or known, and its checksum
as absent or present, depending on a flag about seeking, or on whether it was opened from a
file or from a buffer. Code that branches on "is the size known?" changes behaviour for
reasons unrelated to the archive.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-08-15-simplicity-consistency/SUMMARY.md` findings F1 and
F5, both `CONFIRMED`: enabling seekable members "silently changes **member metadata**: xz
`size` `None`→int; lzip `size` `None`→int **and** `hashes` `{}`→`{CRC32}`. Identical for
`Path` and `BytesIO`, so the gate is the caller's flag, not the source shape" — diagnosed as
an accident of harvesting cheap trailer metadata *through* the index machinery. F5: a
compressed size "filled from a `Path` and `None` from a seekable `BytesIO` — for **every**
single-file codec".

---

### API-21 — An argument only some formats can honour needs one consistent answer, and silence is the wrong one

**Problem.** A uniform interface over many formats necessarily has parameters that are
meaningless for some of them: a text-encoding hint for a format that stores names in a fixed
encoding, a password for a format with no encryption, a strictness knob for a structure the
format lacks. Each such parameter has three possible answers — honour it, refuse it, or
report that it was ignored — and the interface has to give the *same* answer for comparable
parameters, or callers cannot reason about any of them. Silently discarding is the one answer
that leaves the caller believing something happened.

**Symptom.** A caller passes an encoding hint and gets the default decoding on five of seven
formats, with no error and no warning, while passing a password to a format that cannot use
one is refused outright. The two parameters behave incompatibly for no reason visible to the
caller.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-08-15-simplicity-consistency/SUMMARY.md` finding F2,
`CONFIRMED` by both independent passes: "`encoding=` is honoured by ZIP/TAR and **silently
discarded** by 7z, RAR, ISO, directory and single-file. `password=` on a non-encrypting
format is refused; `encoding=` has no analogous gate", diagnosed as the earlier rule "applied
to one argument only". The same review's §Format-scoped config knobs records the *legitimate*
version of inertness — a knob naming a structure the format lacks overrules no caller
assertion — which is what makes the discarded-encoding case different.

---

### API-22 — One unusable member and an unusable archive are different events, and a single pass presents them identically

**Problem.** An archive is a collection of largely independent members, so the useful answer
to "one member is damaged, hostile, or unsupported" is usually "skip it and deliver the
rest" — which is what the established tools do, and what a salvage or backup-indexing
workload requires. But the members arrive from one forward pass over one byte stream, so a
failure raised while producing member *k* ends the pass and takes members *k+1..n* with it.
Per-member failure and archive-level failure become the same event, and the caller cannot
tell how much of what they asked for they actually got.

**Symptom.** An archive with a single hostile or corrupt entry yields *zero* extracted files,
where other tools extract every other entry. A whole-archive verification loop loses every
member after the first failure, so one bad member hides the state of the rest.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-20-cli-product/SUMMARY.md`: a traversal entry means
"*zero* files extracted, under every `--policy` — `unzip` skips it and extracts the rest",
recorded as one of the two failure modes that "would make a new user walk away", both
"silence-shaped". `review/archive/2026-07-19-api-coherence/SUMMARY.md` E2: the verification
loop's "mid-pass failure poisons the stream and loses remaining members". The unmet
general capability is registered as `dev-docs/open-issues.md:279` ("Salvage / best-effort
read mode … all-or-error today").

---

### API-23 — A selection that matches nothing is indistinguishable from a job well done

**Problem.** Any interface that selects a subset of an archive's members admits a selection
that matches none of them, and that is a legal outcome — an archive may genuinely not contain
what was asked for. So "nothing matched" and "nothing needed doing" produce the same
observable result and the same success status. The hazard is not hypothetical: users arrive
with muscle memory from established tools, where an argument in that position means something
else entirely (a destination directory rather than a filter), so the most likely way to
produce an empty selection is to type what another tool taught them.

**Symptom.** A command reports success having done nothing, and a script checking the exit
status does not notice. The user's reflex spelling from another tool is exactly the spelling
that produces it.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-20-cli-product/SUMMARY.md` §First five minutes, a real
session: `archivey x photos.zip out` — "my `unzip`/`7z` reflex for 'extract into `out`'" —
produced "`0 extracted, 0 renamed, 0 skipped → .`, **exit 0** … the success exit meant my
script wouldn't notice either", and the same for a directory-name argument that needed a glob
suffix. Recorded as finding P2, one of the two "silence-shaped" trust-costing failures.

---

### API-24 — The library's own front-end reveals which capabilities have no public form

**Problem.** A library's first real consumer exercises it as an outsider would, and wherever
it reaches into internals, that is a capability the public surface does not express. The
capabilities that go missing are systematically the ones the library needed for itself:
instrumentation counters, a human-readable name for an enumerated value, a whole-archive
verification operation. Each is easy to leave internal precisely because the internal caller
can reach it.

**Symptom.** The library's own command-line tool imports from a private module,
type-checks against an internal class, or parses a debugging representation to get a display
string — and any third-party tool wanting the same thing has to do likewise or go without.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-19-api-coherence/SUMMARY.md` §The CLI case study,
naming three: the instrumentation counters "live only on the internal [base reader class]
(the CLI `isinstance`-checks and imports [the enabling function] from `internal/`)"; the
verify-everything job "has no library primitive (the CLI hand-rolls a 60-line loop with
subtle generator semantics)"; and the format enumeration "has no display name (the CLI
parses `repr()`)". A residual instance is
`review/archive/2026-08-15-simplicity-consistency/SUMMARY.md` F14, where two front-end
modules still import a public type from the private path.

---

### API-25 — Whether a format can be read from a pipe is a fact callers need and cannot compute

**Problem.** Some formats can be read from a forward-only source and some cannot (FQ-04,
FQ-05). A caller deciding whether to stream an incoming archive or spool it to disk first
needs that fact *before* trying, and it is not derivable from anything they can see: not from
the extension, not from the format identifier, not from the availability of a backend. It is
a property of how the format stores its index, which the library knows and does not publish.

**Symptom.** The only way to find out whether a format can be streamed is to attempt it and
catch the refusal — which for a non-rewindable source means the attempt has already consumed
the bytes.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-08-15-simplicity-consistency/SUMMARY.md` finding F8,
`CONFIRMED`: "Whether a format can be read from a pipe is **not queryable**. Refusals are
loud and uniform (good), but `FormatAvailability` carries only `format`/`support`/`missing`;
the fact lives on an `internal/` class attribute", with a recorded freeze cost because the
availability type is public.

---

### API-26 — A read of *n* bytes is allowed to return fewer, and real sources do

**Problem.** The raw byte-stream contract is *up to* n bytes, not exactly n. Ordinary
sources exercise that latitude: a socket returns what has arrived, a network filesystem
returns what a request yielded, a caller's own wrapper returns whatever its inner call gave.
A parser that reads a fixed-size structure and treats a short return as end-of-input therefore
reports a perfectly healthy archive as truncated or corrupt, and it does so only for callers
whose source happens to be one of those.

The reason this survives testing is structural: the obvious in-memory test doubles are all
built on a buffer that is always full-count, so no test returns short, and the entire class of
bug is invisible however thorough the suite looks.

**Symptom.** An archive that opens correctly from a file fails with a corruption or truncation
error when the identical bytes are supplied through a socket or a user-written stream wrapper.
The failure implicates the archive, which is fine.

**Evidence.** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-08-01-short-read-source-contract/proposal.md`:
"Header parsers assumed the full count and read a short return as EOF, so a **healthy** archive
supplied as such a stream was reported as [corrupt or truncated]: 26 of 27
committed RAR/ZIP fixtures, the `tar` / `zip` / `iso` corpus formats" — and the blind spot:
"Nothing in `tests/` returned short — `NonSeekableBytesIO` and `CountingBytesIO` both delegate
to `BytesIO`, which is always full-count — which is why this was invisible for the whole of
Phase 2."

---

### API-27 — A damaged member and a refused member are different events that must not share a stop condition

**Problem.** Two things halt a bulk operation over an archive's members, and they mean
opposite things. A *failure* — data that will not decode, a checksum that does not match — says
the archive is broken. A *block* — a member refused because its name would escape the
destination, or because a policy declined it — says the safety layer worked exactly as designed.
Treating both as "an error occurred" makes the stop-on-error setting abort an otherwise
perfectly good archive the moment one member is unsafe, which is the opposite of the behaviour
that motivates having a safety layer at all. It also makes an exit status unanswerable: the
same code has to mean "your archive is damaged" and "I protected you".

**Symptom.** An archive containing one hostile entry stops with an error under a setting the
caller chose to catch *damage*, and the rest of a good archive goes unextracted. A script
cannot distinguish "this archive is broken" from "this archive contained something I refused".

**Evidence.** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-20-stop-on-failure-not-policy/proposal.md`:
"`OnError.STOP` currently halts on **both** a member *failure* … and a policy *block* … These
are different in kind: a failure means the archive is broken; a block is the safe-extraction
library working **as designed**. Conflating them means STOP aborts an otherwise-good archive
the moment one member is unsafe — the opposite of 'skip the unsafe member and keep going,'
which is the library's defining behavior." The unanswerable exit-status question it created is
recorded in `review/archive/2026-07-20-cli-product/`.

---

### API-28 — The unit an operation is measured in and the unit it reports in are not the same

**Problem.** A bulk operation over an archive has a natural reporting boundary — the member —
and a natural work unit, which is a chunk of bytes. If progress is emitted only at the member
boundary, then a single large member is one report: a consumer drawing a progress display shows
nothing for the duration of the largest item and then jumps by its whole size. The finer figure
usually exists already, because whatever enforces per-member limits has to count bytes as they
are written; it simply never leaves that component.

**Symptom.** A progress display freezes for the duration of the biggest file in the archive
and then leaps, which reads as a hang on exactly the archives where progress matters most.

**Evidence.** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-15-extraction-progress-in-file/proposal.md`:
progress "fires **once per member**, after the member is fully written … extracting one large
member shows a frozen bar that jumps by the whole member size in a single step at completion",
and "the data to do better already exists" — the ratio guard is fed per copy chunk and
maintains the running in-member figure "because the per-member ratio check needs" it.

---

### API-29 — Advisory events have two different subjects, and one escalation switch cannot serve both

**Problem.** API-09 establishes that advisory conditions should be data rather than log lines.
This is the distinction that emerges once they are: some advisories are about *the archive* —
its name needed rewriting, its trailer was missing, its digest could not be checked — and some
are about *the caller's request* — you passed an argument this format cannot use, the access
pattern you chose is expensive. They are unrelated facts with unrelated audiences. A single
channel with a single per-code escalation setting therefore makes "treat this as an error" mean
two different things, and a caller who escalates broadly to catch damaged archives also
escalates their own harmless argument choices.

The problem compounds where an advisory duplicates a value the call already returns: the same
fact then has two channels, and escalating the advisory turns a per-item outcome the caller was
going to inspect into an exception that ends the operation.

**Symptom.** Turning on strict handling to catch bad archives makes ordinary calls raise for
reasons that are about the call, not the archive. And an event that also appears as a returned
per-member result raises instead, so the caller's own handling of that result never runs.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/discussions/2026-08-diagnostics/diagnostics-archive-vs-usage.md`, whose
title is the question — written to be read standalone, with the count: "**Eight of the
twenty-two break it**", the taxonomy having grown from 15 codes to 22, and the consequence
stated as "**`RAISE` means two unrelated things**" plus "Extraction has two parallel channels
for the same facts". Three independent outside reviews of it are in the same directory.

---

### API-30 — Guaranteeing a full-count read and salvaging a truncated prefix are the same call

**Problem.** These two requirements are individually right and collide at one call site. A
source may legally return fewer bytes than asked for (API-26), so a parser needs a layer that
gathers across short returns before it can trust a fixed-size read. But a *decoder* returns
short for a different reason — the data ended early — and the contract there is to deliver the
recoverable prefix and raise on the next read (PERF-04, API-16). A gathering layer cannot tell
the two apart from the return value alone: it sees a short return in both cases. Make it
gather, and it keeps asking a truncated decoder for more until the decoder raises — which pulls
the error into the first call and discards the prefix that was the point. Do not make it
gather, and the parser above it misreads a legal short read as the end of the archive.

**Symptom.** Fixing the short-read case silently destroys truncation salvage: a read over a
damaged member that previously returned a few hundred recoverable bytes returns nothing and
raises immediately instead.

**Evidence.** Measured in
`openspec/changes/archive/2026-08-01-short-read-source-contract/design.md`: making every sized
view gather "collapses the deliver-then-raise truncation shape ADR-0014 requires — measured on
a slice over a truncated xz/gzip/zlib decoder, the recoverable prefix went from 201/247/248
bytes to zero, with [the truncation error] pulled into the first call." The colliding
requirements are ADR 0014 (full-count reads, and verdicts from reads) and the raw-stream
up-to-n contract (API-26).

---


## Packaging & dependency

### PKG-01 — An optional dependency that is imported at module scope is not optional

**Problem.** Support for some formats and codecs requires third-party packages that will not
be present in every installation — native wheels that do not exist for every platform and
architecture, packages with build dependencies, packages a user declined. If the code
importing them runs at import time, an absent package makes the entire library unimportable,
so an installation missing an ISO reader cannot read ZIP files either.

**Symptom.** Importing the library raises an import error naming a package the user has never
heard of and does not need. Or a format silently appears to be supported and fails much later,
at the moment data is read.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/ARCHITECTURE.md:543-582` and `history/SPEC.md:817`: the
registration guard pattern, and "an absent dependency simply makes the format unavailable (it
never appears in `list_formats()`)"; the error message names the extra to install.

---

### PKG-02 — A codec's best provider changes with the language version and over time

**Problem.** Which package should provide a codec is not a stable fact. A codec can arrive in
the standard library in a new language version, so the right answer differs across the
supported version range; several third-party bindings of one codec exist with different APIs
and materially different behaviour (UL-11); a binding can be deprecated, or acquire a
dependency on a backport of the standard-library module, changing which one is the smaller
surface. Depending on a specific package therefore encodes a decision that expires.

**Symptom.** The same code has different truncation and seeking behaviour depending on which
package the environment resolved, and a dependency chosen for good reasons becomes the wrong
one without anything in the project changing.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/library-analysis.md:81-151`: five candidate providers for one codec,
with a measured behaviour table, and the decision to target the standard-library API and its
backport rather than any third-party binding — partly because a competing binding "depends on
`backports.zstd` for Python < 3.14" so targeting that API covers it too. Also `:55` (core on
3.14+, an extra below).

---

### PKG-03 — Behaviour depends on both the presence and the version of optional packages

**Problem.** With optional providers for codecs and accelerators, the behaviour under test is
not one program but a family of them: with everything installed, with nothing installed, and
with the oldest permitted version of each. Truncation detection, seeking cost, error types and
crash exposure all differ across those. A test suite run in one configuration proves nothing
about the others, and a finding reported without naming its configuration is not reproducible.

**Symptom.** A bug reproduces on one developer's machine and not another's, or in one
continuous-integration leg and not the rest, with no difference in the code.

**Evidence.** `review/README.md` §Conventions ("Three dependency configs. Behaviour changes by
both presence and version of optional libs … Say which config a finding reproduces in").
Measured version-dependent behaviour differences at `dev-docs/known-issues.md:278-311` and
`dev-docs/library-analysis.md:102-116`.

---

### PKG-04 — A required external tool may be absent, or present as a different program with the same name

**Problem.** Delegating to an external binary makes the host's contents part of the library's
behaviour. The tool may not be installed. Worse, several different programs answer to the same
name with different capabilities: one handles little of the modern format version, another's
coverage varies by build, a third exists only on one platform. A fallback matrix across them
produces divergent behaviour on solid archives and passwords, per machine, presented as one
feature.

**Symptom.** Reading an archive works on one machine and fails on another with the same
package versions installed; or it appears to work and handles a subset of the format, failing
on archives that use the rest.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/threat-model.md:347-359` (C1: `unrar` is non-free freeware,
`unrar-free` "handles little of RAR5", `7z`/`bsdtar` coverage varies by build, `unar` exists on
macOS; a multi-tool fallback matrix "would otherwise degrade into 'works on my machine' plus
divergent solid/password behavior").

---

### PKG-05 — Producing test archives for a format can require a tool that cannot be shipped

**Problem.** Testing that a reader handles a format correctly means having archives in that
format. Generating them requires the format's *writer*, and for a proprietary format the
writer may be trialware — installable, but a licensing decision rather than a technical one.
Committing pre-built archives instead trades that for binary artifacts in the repository. So
the format's entire test column can end up running nowhere, and — because the suite still
reports green — nobody notices.

**Symptom.** A test suite passes with a whole format's coverage silently skipped. The gap is
invisible in the pass count and only appears if someone counts skips.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/investigations/rar-corpus-sweep-diagnosis.md`: the corpus's RAR column
"runs on **no CI leg and in no provisioned dev environment**". Once the writer was installed,
**four of eight** entries failed, one of them a genuine reader bug (FQ-18) hidden by the gap;
enabling the column added **42 tests that previously ran nowhere**. Licensing is named as the
reason and explicitly left as a maintainer decision. Pinning test
`tests/test_review_simplicity_consistency.py:520`
(`test_rar_column_is_unmeasured_without_the_rar_writer`), which documents the gap and skips
when the writer is present.

---

### PKG-06 — Every hard dependency is imposed on every user, including those who never use it

**Problem.** A dependency in the base install is paid by everyone: it must resolve on every
supported platform and version, it can conflict with a consumer's own pins, and it is a
supply-chain surface. Convenience dependencies — a progress-bar library, typing backports for
older language versions, a compatibility shim — are the easiest to add and the least likely to
be needed by a given user, and they are hardest to remove later because they appear in the
public surface.

**Symptom.** A library used for one archive format drags in unrelated packages; a consumer
with a version conflict cannot install it at all.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/COMPARISON.md:59,190,217` (hard dependencies on a progress-bar
library and two backports, dropped for a zero-dependency core, with the progress bar becoming a
callback used only by the command-line tool). Decided in ADR
[`0011-zero-dependency-core`](../../dev-docs/decisions/0011-zero-dependency-core.md).

---

### PKG-07 — The supported language-version range is a moving constraint at both ends

**Problem.** The oldest supported version determines which backports are needed and which
standard-library capabilities are unavailable; it also has an end-of-life date, after which
supporting it costs dependencies for a shrinking audience. The newest version brings both new
standard-library modules that replace third-party dependencies (PKG-02) and new interpreter
builds with different concurrency semantics. Neither end holds still.

**Symptom.** Dependencies exist solely to paper over the oldest supported version, and code
carries version-conditional paths for capabilities that are unconditional a version later.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/history/COMPARISON.md:215-218`: raising the floor "drops two backport
deps; 3.10 is EOL October 2026 anyway", against a matrix spanning four newer versions.
Version-dependent codec availability at `dev-docs/library-analysis.md:55`.

---

### PKG-08 — A guard installed into another library's namespace is visible to everyone else using it

**Problem.** Working around a defect inside a third-party library (UL-02) sometimes requires
changing that library's behaviour rather than one's own. Doing so at import time modifies
process-global state: any other code in the same process that uses that library sees the
modification, whether or not it wanted the fix. The alternative is to leave the defect in
place for callers who reach the library through this one.

**Symptom.** A program that uses both this library and the patched one directly gets subtly
different behaviour from the latter, and nothing in its own code explains why.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/known-issues.md:35-50`: the guard is described as installed
"permanently" into the third-party library's own namespace, confined to it rather than a global
swap, with the trade named explicitly — "hang-safety on hostile input over leaving another
library's pycdlib untouched" — and the mitigating argument that the guard is a strict superset
of the library's behaviour on valid trees.

---

### PKG-09 — An archive rebuilt from identical inputs is not byte-identical to the last build

**Problem.** Archive formats embed the moment of writing — creation timestamps in headers,
sometimes in the container metadata as well. Building the same content twice therefore
produces two different files. Any check of the form "rebuild it and compare the bytes" is
permanently unavailable, and a checksum over a stored archive proves only that the file was
not damaged in transit — something version control already guarantees. So the failure mode of
a stored test archive is *silent staleness*: the definition it was built from is edited, the
archive still sits there testing the old shape, and no hash of the bytes can notice.

**Symptom.** A test suite is green while testing something the project no longer describes.
Alternatively, a continuous-integration check that compares rebuilt bytes is red forever, for
a reason unrelated to any defect.

**Evidence.** ADR
[`0016-committed-rar-corpus-fixtures`](../../dev-docs/decisions/0016-committed-rar-corpus-fixtures.md)
§"Why the manifest, and not a hash of the bytes": "A regenerated RAR is also **never**
byte-identical to its predecessor, because archives embed timestamps. So 'rebuild and
compare' is not available as a CI check, and any scheme that assumed it would be perpetually
red."

---

### PKG-10 — An optional dependency group named after a format cannot be scoped by format

**Problem.** Optional installs are named for what a user is trying to do — read this format —
but codecs do not partition that way. A codec is shared: the same entropy coder appears as a
member codec in several container formats, so the package that supplies it belongs to all of
them or none. Naming a group after one format then makes the *error message* wrong in a
specific and damaging way: a member of format A that needs the shared codec tells the user to
install the group named for format B, which reads as if the library misidentified their file.

Two more consequences follow from the same mismatch. Groups end up byte-identical to each
other while implying different meanings, so one codec is reachable under two names. And a
group named for a format whose data needs an *external binary* promises something no package
installer can deliver.

**Symptom.** A user reading one format is told to install support for a different one. Two
install options do the same thing under different names. An install option appears to enable a
format and does not, because the missing piece was never a package.

**Evidence.** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-30-consolidate-optional-extras/proposal.md`:
"`[7z]` pulls seven packages, six of which are member codecs shared with ZIP and TAR — so a
ZIP member using Deflate64 or PPMd raises `PackageNotInstalledError: pip install
archivey[7z]`. That hint is *correct* and reads like the library misidentified the file. The
name is what lies, not the message." Plus the identical-groups and external-binary cases, both
recorded there.

---

### PKG-11 — A transitive dependency can refuse the interpreter build the project tests on

**Problem.** An optional install pulls a chain of packages, and any link in it may decline to
build for a particular interpreter variant. A newer interpreter build with different
concurrency semantics is exactly the case: a dependency several levels down can reject it
outright, so the *recommended* install fails on a runtime the project itself exercises in
continuous integration — and nothing in the install metadata says so, because the refusal
belongs to someone else's package. The gap closes when that package fixes it upstream, which
means the correct expression of it is a version-conditional marker rather than an omission.

**Symptom.** The install command the documentation recommends fails outright on one
interpreter build, with an error from a package the user has never heard of, while the same
command works everywhere else.

**Evidence.** `openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-30-consolidate-optional-extras/proposal.md`,
measured: "`pip install archivey[recommended]` fails outright on free-threaded CPython 3.13 —
`[recommended]` → `[7z]` → `cryptography` → `cffi`, and cffi rejects free-threaded 3.13
('upgrade to free-threaded 3.14 or newer'). The recommended install is therefore uninstallable
on a runtime the project tests in CI, and nothing in the extras table says so." Verified on the
next version: the dependency installs and works, so it is a one-version gap already fixed
upstream.

---


## Concurrency & lifetime

### CONC-01 — Most archives are one byte source, so two concurrent readers of different members contend for one position

**Problem.** An archive is usually a single file read through a single handle. Serving two
members at once means two consumers issuing seeks and reads against one position; each read
must be preceded by a seek to that member's own offset, and if the two interleave, each
receives bytes from the other's position. This is not a defect in any component — it is what a
single shared cursor means. Third-party readers frequently do exactly this, re-seeking on every
read with no synchronization of their own.

**Symptom.** Reading two members of one archive returns bytes belonging to the wrong member,
with no error. It does **not** take two threads: two interleaved reads on one thread are
enough, because the second read moves the position the first will resume from. Adding threads
only makes it intermittent and data-dependent as well.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/investigations/parallel-reader.md:44-60`: the standard tar reader's
member file object "re-seeks on each `read()`, **no lock**", and the ISO library's stream
object has "the same shape". The standard zip reader does coordinate seek and read internally,
but its reference-count updates race without the interpreter lock. Per-format parallelizable
units and their constraints at `:141-154`. The single-threaded case is spelled out with a
worked interleaving in
`openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-12-shared-source-streams/proposal.md`: two open member
streams over regions at different offsets, where the second read "leaves the handle at 5100"
so the first "MUST seek back to 1100 first, or it reads big2's bytes" — "**even in a single
thread**".

---

### CONC-02 — A single subprocess pipe carries every member's bytes in one undelimited stream

**Problem.** When member data comes from an external tool, the efficient invocation asks it for
everything at once and reads one pipe: one process for the whole archive rather than one per
member, which for a solid archive is the difference between one decode and *n*. But the pipe is
a single undelimited byte stream. Splitting it back into members relies entirely on the sizes
declared in the archive's own metadata, and on knowing exactly which members the tool emits
bytes for at all — link members may produce zero bytes, and whether they do depends on the
format version, because one version stores the target in the header and another stores it as
member data. Get the emission model wrong for one member kind and every subsequent member's
bytes are offset.

**Symptom.** Members after some particular kind of entry contain another member's data,
shifted, with checksums failing from that point on. Adding support for a new member kind
breaks members unrelated to it.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/open-issues.md:207-216` (P6): "Solid ALL-pipe demux must match what
`unrar` actually emits (RAR5 symlink targets in header → 0 stdout bytes; RAR3 symlink targets in
LZ data → also 0 after decode). Easy to desync on new member kinds." The storage-shape
difference is measured in `investigations/rar-corpus-sweep-diagnosis.md:58-89` (FQ-18).

---

### CONC-03 — A stream handed to a caller can outlive the thing that produced it

**Problem.** A reader that returns a stream over a member has given away a reference to its own
internal state. The caller may hold it after closing the archive, drop it without closing it, or
close the underlying source themselves while it is live. Each has a different bad outcome:
tearing down resources under a live stream can be the exact operation that aborts the process
with some decoders (UL-05); leaving them alive indefinitely leaks descriptors; and invalidating
the stream contradicts a caller who was told it stays usable. The lifetime question has to be
answered for all three at once.

**Symptom.** A file descriptor per forgotten stream leaks for the life of the process; or
closing an archive crashes it; or a stream that worked yesterday raises today.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/open-issues.md:98-160` (P7), measured on all seven backends: reading
after archive close succeeded everywhere and dropping a stream without closing leaked one
descriptor per stream, unchanged after three explicit collections. The competing considerations
are laid out there — a general principle against silently invalidating a held stream, the
decoder abort hazard running the other way, and the standard library doing the opposite
(UL-17).

---

### CONC-04 — Archive-wide limits cannot be enforced from parallel workers

**Problem.** Guards that bound a whole operation — total bytes written, total entries, an
overall ratio — are cumulative counters by definition. Distributing the work that increments them
across workers makes every increment a contended update, and a limit that is checked after the
fact on each worker's local total does not bound the aggregate. The guard's correctness depends
on a property that parallelism removes.

**Symptom.** A parallelized extraction exceeds its own configured output limit, by a margin that
scales with the number of workers, without reporting that any limit was crossed.

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/investigations/parallel-reader.md:170-173`: "archive-wide limits
(`max_entries`, `max_extracted_bytes`, ratio guard) must stay on a single coordinator thread (or
a locked counter); workers only produce bytes / paths."

---

### CONC-05 — A native decompressor's threads are invisible to the language's own concurrency model

**Problem.** A decompressor implemented in C++ starts its own operating-system threads. The host
language's threading module does not know about them, cannot enumerate them, and cannot join or
interrupt them. Nothing that reasons about concurrency in host-language terms — a timeout, a
signal handler, a thread-count assertion, a test harness's cleanup — reaches them. A busy loop
inside one of those threads (SEC-18) cannot be interrupted at all.

**Symptom.** A process appears idle or hung with no host-language stack to inspect; timeouts do
not fire; and the interpreter's own shutdown sequence collides with work it does not know is
running (UL-03).

**Evidence.** `dev-docs/known-issues.md:73-79` ("spawn **C++ worker threads** (`std::thread`s,
invisible to Python's `threading` module)"); `dev-docs/investigations/parallel-reader.md:131-137`
(free-threading "does not remove the close-before-finalize requirement").

---

### CONC-06 — An asynchronous exception during a shared one-time build leaves every waiter stranded

**Problem.** A lazily-built shared structure needs three states — not built, being built,
built — and a waiter that arrives during the second state must block until the builder
publishes. An interrupt or a memory exhaustion can arrive inside the build at any point.
Unless that path returns the state to "not built" and wakes the waiters, the builder
disappears leaving the state permanently "being built": a single-threaded caller gets a
misleading error about a structure nobody is building, and waiters block forever on a
condition nothing will signal again. Both failures are of the mechanism, not of the archive.

**Symptom.** Pressing the interrupt key during a listing wedges the object: subsequent calls
report something unrelated, or other threads hang. Recovering requires abandoning the object
entirely.

**Evidence.** `review/archive/2026-07-12-codebase-deep-review/SUMMARY.md` finding 2:
"`BaseException` (Ctrl-C / MemoryError) during member materialization leaves the reader
wedged: non-concurrent → misleading error, CONCURRENT → CV deadlock", traced in that
review's `concurrency.md` C1 and `latent-bugs.md` L2, and listed as a change to make ("Reader
survives Ctrl-C; no CV deadlock").
