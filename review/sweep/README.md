# `sweep/` — the whole-codebase reading pass (#315)

A cold **whole-file** reading pass over `src/`, run one batch at a time by a fresh agent,
posting to [#315](https://github.com/davitf/archivey/pull/315). Not a diff review: the point
is the code nobody has read, not the code someone just changed. #315 is the hub — its head
*is* `main` and its base is an orphan branch, so inline comments re-anchor against current
code and it is never merged.

This directory holds the conventions. The state — which files are swept, and what each
reading found — lives on #315 itself.

| Which batches were planned (S1–S14) and in what order | [`dev-docs/open-work-inventory.md`](../../dev-docs/open-work-inventory.md) — **the plan, not the record.** Batches get re-cut as they run; the markers say what was actually read |

## One `SWEPT` marker per file, findings or not

Every file an agent finishes reading gets one top-level comment on #315 whose first line is
the marker. Findings stay as they were: one inline thread each, IDs prefixed by the batch and
the reviewer's initial.

The reason is a counting failure, not bookkeeping taste. Coverage was reported as 24% and
then 35% against a truth of 12% and 23%, because a file with no findings and a file nobody
opened looked identical on #315, and fifteen maintainer questions were read as sweep output.
`backends/rar_parser.py` — the largest file here, and the most exposed to hostile input — sat
in the swept column having never been read. Two sweep threads also reached opposite
conclusions about `internal/volumes.py` and `streams/crypto.py` from the same evidence.

## The sixteen files swept before the markers existed — backfilled

The 2026-09-08 pass (nine files) and batches S1 and S2 (seven files) were read before this
convention. The maintainer's call on 2026-09-19 was to **backfill** them rather than leave
them invisible or re-sweep them, and the sixteen markers are on #315.

Each one carries `backfilled=2026-09-19` and says in its own text that nobody re-read the
file — the marker records the pass that did. They were reconstructed from the paths the
threads landed on, the S1 and S2 scope tables, and `main`'s tip on the pass date. The
reconstruction reproduces the hand-derived figure on
[`open-work-inventory.md`](../../dev-docs/open-work-inventory.md) for those three passes
exactly — 16 files, 8 299 lines — which is the check that it is not a fresh guess. What the
sixteen come to as a share of `src/` has already moved since, because batches ran the same
day; take that figure from the script.

Two caveats live in the markers rather than here. The 2026-09-08 pass recorded no head, so
`head=7ed4879` is inferred from the date; and its file list comes from the paths its findings
landed on, so a file it read and found clean is not represented anywhere and never can be.

## Coverage decays, and fastest where the sweep worked best

The backfill made something visible that the thread counts never could: seven of the nine
files from 2026-09-08 have drifted more than 10% since they were read, all of them in
`streamtools/` and neither native backend. The cause is the sweep's own success — five of the
nine commits that rewrote `streamtools/` since that pass are the parcels that fixed the
findings the pass produced.

So "swept" decays, and it decays furthest exactly where the follow-up was most thorough. That
is why a marker records `lines=` as read rather than pointing at the file: it is what lets
[`sweep_coverage.py`](../../scripts/sweep_coverage.py) report a file as drifted instead of
counting a stale read as current.
[`dev-docs/open-work-inventory.md`](../../dev-docs/open-work-inventory.md) carries the
measured table.

**A re-sweep of `streamtools/` is decided, and the answer is not now** (davi, 2026-09-19):
finish reading the whole codebase and fix what that turns up, then make another pass. Do not
propose it again before the first pass is complete. Record drift where the markers already do
— it is what makes the later pass cheap to scope — and leave the scheduling alone.
