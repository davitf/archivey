"""What a caller-supplied stream costs, measured across two source trees.

The harness (``benchmarks/harness.py``) opens every case from a ``Path``. That is the
cheap path and the one the gate watches, but it is blind to the source boundary's
treatment of a *stream*: a ``Path`` is opened by the reader, which owns the handle, so
nothing the boundary does to a caller's object shows up there at all. This probe fills
that gap. It is a **probe, not a gate** — it writes no baseline and CI does not run it.

Run it against one tree::

    uv run --extra all python -m benchmarks.caller_stream_probe --repeats 8

Compare two trees by pointing ``PYTHONPATH`` at each one's ``src`` in turn. The
interpreter, the installed dependencies and the fixtures stay identical, so the only
thing that differs is archivey itself::

    git worktree add /tmp/before <sha>
    ARCHIVEY_BENCH_CACHE=/tmp/bench-corpus \\
        PYTHONPATH=/tmp/before/src uv run --no-sync python -m \\
        benchmarks.caller_stream_probe --repeats 8 --out /tmp/before.json
    ARCHIVEY_BENCH_CACHE=/tmp/bench-corpus \\
        uv run --no-sync python -m benchmarks.caller_stream_probe \\
        --repeats 8 --out /tmp/after.json
    python -m benchmarks.caller_stream_probe --compare /tmp/before.json /tmp/after.json

``ARCHIVEY_BENCH_CACHE`` is what makes the two sides comparable: without it each run
builds its own corpus, and the harness's first comparison rule is to check the workload
before the clock. This module imports only the public API and
``benchmarks.fixtures``, so one copy of it runs unchanged against an older tree that
never contained it.

**Reading the numbers.** Per-case wall noise here is a few percent, so the driver
alternates the two sides and takes the per-case minimum, as ``harness.py`` prescribes;
one run each way cannot resolve a small effect. Every shape is a treatment, ``path``
included: the source boundary builds one object for a path too, so no shape is left
untouched to serve as the control. The noise floor comes from each side instead. With
``--compare-globs`` and at least two runs a side, the runs of one side are split into
odd and even halves and compared with each other; that ratio is what the same code
measures against itself, and every before/after ratio should be read against it, not
against 1.00.

The shapes: ``path`` is a ``Path``; ``file`` is ``open(path, "rb")``, already buffered;
``bytesio`` is a ``BytesIO``, also already buffered; ``raw`` is
``open(path, "rb", buffering=0)``, a seekable ``RawIOBase`` with no buffer, the one shape
the boundary adds a read buffer to.

Measurement is **off**. It is the benchmark harness's own switch, it adds a wrapper on
both sides, and an ordinary caller never enables it — so leaving it on would measure a
cost nobody pays and hide the one they do.
