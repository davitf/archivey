# Reviewing OpenSpec proposals & design docs (not code)

> Two readers. A **proposal, delta spec or `design.md`** uses the whole file, in its order.
> A **contract-moving code PR** uses only the values & contracts check below — that is §8's

§8's **code-first** ordering is for **actual code / PR reviews**. When the artifact under
review is an OpenSpec **proposal**, delta spec, or `design.md` — not a diff — there is no
"resulting tree" to read cold. Review it against the project's **values and contracts**
instead. (This same check is pass-2 step 2 for code reviews — see §8; for a proposal it
is the *whole* review.)

Finding discipline (§0) applies unchanged: severity × confidence, over-report and label,
pause-and-ask on conflicts rather than silently reconciling.

### Values & contracts consistency check (VISION / CONTRIBUTING)

Run every proposal — and every contract-moving code change — past these:

- [ ] **Uniform interface / no surprises (§2):** one honest interface preserved? Every
  per-format behavior difference expressed as **data** (`None`, enums, documented
  sentinels), never a silent guess?
- [ ] **Safe by default (§1.2):** zip-slip / symlink escape / bombs still require explicit
  opt-out; the design doesn't quietly relax a safety contract.
- [ ] **Memory-safe hostile parsing (§1.3):** pure-Python parse boundaries preserved;
  crafted input yields honest errors, not native-memory corruption.
- [ ] **Damaged input is first-class (§1.4):** recoverable-members + honest-error posture
  preserved; salvage isn't invented where the backlog hasn't committed to it.
- [ ] **Cost honesty & perf budget (§1.5):** cost signals stay truthful; ≤ ~1.3× budget
  acknowledged in bytes/seeks (not vibes) where the design touches hot paths.
- [ ] **Contracts (§3):** zero-dep core, exception-translation model, sync-first, typing
  story, extras layering — none silently broken by the *design*.
- [ ] **Non-goals (§1):** not smuggling in an async public API, `zipfile`/`py7zr`/`rarfile`
  compat shims, quirk-driven architecture, or in-place 7z/RAR modification.
- [ ] **Threat-model gaps (`O*`):** open gaps the proposal touches are addressed in
  substance, not closed by marketing language.

### Proposal-shape checks

- [ ] **Scope right-sized (§3):** does this actually need a spec/change, or is it a
  bugfix/refactor that moves no contract?
- [ ] **Scenarios are falsifiable:** WHEN/THEN reads as testable behavior, not aspiration
  — a reviewer could write the conformance assertion.
- [ ] **Cross-format parity considered:** the parity hot spots in §2 are addressed where
  the change spans backends.
- [ ] **Error / edge / hostile paths specified**, not just the happy path (§4, §5).
- [ ] **Rationale present:** `design.md` records alternatives considered and the *why*,
  per the library schema — not just the *what* (stub OK for trivial deltas).
- [ ] **Docs move together:** if the contract moves, the matching `openspec/specs/` and
  user/decision docs move in the same change (§3).
- [ ] **Pause-and-ask** on conflicts with existing specs / docs / VISION — surface, don't
  silently reconcile (§3).
- [ ] **Names of public types are settled here, not after implementation.** If a proposal
  introduces a public class, protocol or config field, the name is a reviewable item at
  *this* stage — raise it now. Once the type is implemented, a rename is a spec and
  archive sweep rather than a one-line edit, so after implementation a rename needs a
  reason beyond taste and is the maintainer's call. (`FullCountStream` cost two rounds on
  #333 for exactly this reason, and the maintainer's note there was "we should have
  caught this while reviewing the spec".)

### Decision gaps & unknown unknowns

The checks above verify what the proposal *says*; this step hunts what it **doesn't**.
Go looking, don't wait for gaps to surface during implementation.

- [ ] **Implementor decision gaps** — read it as if you must implement it tomorrow. What
  would force you to *guess*? Under-specified error behavior, ambiguous field meaning,
  unhandled format/edge combinations, boundary/empty/overflow values, ordering,
  defaults, concurrency. List each as an explicit question the proposal should **decide
  before coding**, not during.
- [ ] **Unknown unknowns** — what is the proposal not thinking about? Format quirks not
  yet considered, interactions with existing capabilities, cross-format parity fallout
  (§2 hot spots), perf/cost surprises, security edges, dependency/version assumptions.
  Name what we *don't yet know* that could change the design, and how to shrink the
  unknown (spike, oracle comparison against `archivey-dev`/`py7zr`/`rarfile`, corpus
  probe, or a maintainer decision).
- [ ] **Assumptions taken on faith** — for each load-bearing assumption, is it verified
  or assumed? Flag the untested ones and the cheapest way to test them.

These are findings too (§0): a decision gap that could send implementation down the wrong
path is 🟡+ and belongs in **block 3 (Maintainer decisions)** — pause-and-ask, never a
silent assumption baked into the review. Detail for whoever revises the proposal goes in
block 2.

Rank the same way (§0/§7): a proposal that undercuts a load-bearing VISION claim (§1) is
🔴; a decision gap or thin scenario is 🟡; wording nits are 🟢. Emit the same
three-block output shape (§0).
