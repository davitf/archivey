# Reviewing a code PR — first look

> For round 1 of a code PR, or any reviewer reading a PR for the first time. Round 2 on is
> [`fix-round.md`](fix-round.md); a proposal or `design.md` is

Archivey PRs are reviewed **code first, then context**. That replaces the generic "absorb
the design narrative before the diff" order. Context is still **required** — it comes
second, not never.

## Logistics (≤1 minute, before either pass)

1. Scope: `git diff main...HEAD` (or the paths / PR named); size (>400 lines? ask to
   split).
2. CI status if posted (`ruff`, pyrefly/ty, pytest) — glance only, **do not re-run**
   (`SKILL.md` §6); enough to know whether failures are in-scope. Not posted → say so,
   don't infer.
3. Linked artifact **names** only (issue #, `openspec/changes/<name>/`, `review/` finding
   ID) — what to open in pass 2, not the prose yet. Do **not** read the OpenSpec change,
   design notes, or long PR rationale yet.
4. `CONTRIBUTING.md`, once, for the rules the checklists below cite.

## Pass 1 — code alone

Read the changed code (diff + nearby context) **cold**. Ask:

- [ ] Does the **resulting** code make sense **self-contained** — logic, edge cases,
  API shape, safety/streaming/cost without needing external docs?
- [ ] Are **non-obvious** choices explained **in the code** (or an adjacent module
  docstring / comment) — format quirks, hostile-input edges, why this branch /
  sentinel / exception path exists?
- [ ] Would a future editor who only has the tree (not the PR or OpenSpec change)
  understand *why*, not just *what*?
- [ ] Tests: behavior coverage, red–green for fixes (§Testing); domain checklist rows that
  are visible from the change (§Domain checklist)

Per area:

- **Logic** — edge cases, off-by-one, `None`, hostile or truncated input
- **Security** — path traversal, bombs, subprocess safety, secrets
- **Performance** — silent re-decompression, unbounded buffers, O(n²) member loops
- **Architecture** — fits the problem, consistent with existing backends, right module layer
- **Reuse** — look for an existing helper before accepting new code; check adjacent modules.
  Also ask whether the standard library already does it: on #418 the maintainer asked,
  after the loop had approved, whether a custom cache class could be `functools.cache`
- **Tests** — behavior coverage, red–green for fixes, edge/hostile cases
- **Maintainability** — clear names, one job per function, no magic numbers in parsers

Don't hand-review what tooling already owns: formatting, import order, lint violations,
typos. Skim the checklists below as a **mental checklist**, not by loading linked designs.

**Documentation debt rule:** if a pass-1 concern only dissolves after reading
external prose (OpenSpec `design.md`, long PR body, `dev-docs/decisions/`, …), that is
usually **🟡 `[important]` documentation debt in the code** — not proof you should
have absorbed the design first. A comment that **summarizes *why* inline** and
optionally points at a spec / decision / exploration is fine; a bare “see design.md”
with no local reason is not. Specs and design notes explain *why we chose this
approach*; they are a poor substitute for *why this local path exists*.

**Record what pass 1 found, in the Snapshot's `Pass 1 (cold)` line** (`SKILL.md` §3):
what the code alone did not explain, with the finding IDs, or `nothing`. Those findings
are 🟡 by default, under the rule above. The line exists because the cold read was not
checkable: across 35 first-look reviews on 2026-09-23/24, two said they read the code
first, only five findings carried the documentation-debt label, and some of those were
filed at 🟢 or 💡 (maintainer decision, davitf, 2026-09-24). A cold read that found nothing
says `nothing` — that is an answer, not an omission.

## Pass 2 — whole context (do not skip)

Now open the narrative and contracts:

1. PR description + linked issue / full OpenSpec change (proposal, delta specs,
   `design.md`) / `review/` brief or finding.
2. Applicable sections below (VISION ranking, contract checks, domain checklist)
   and the authoritative sources `SKILL.md` §1 lists when a finding touches them. For a
   contract-moving change, run the **values & contracts consistency check** — the same
   checklist proposals get, applied to the resulting behavior. It is the first section of
   [`reviewing-proposals.md`](reviewing-proposals.md), and the only one a code PR needs.
3. Spec ↔ code ↔ docs: match, intentional revision, or **pause-and-ask** (§Coding and
   contract checks) — including “self-contained and clear, but disagrees with the
   capability scenario / invents undecided behavior / breaks format parity.”
4. Run a command only to reproduce or test a specific claim — not to re-run the
   gates — and then say exactly what you ran (`SKILL.md` §6).
5. Write feedback in the **three-block output shape** (`SKILL.md` §3) — briefing, implementor
   handoff, maintainer decisions — with skill severity labels; put pause-and-ask items
   in block 3, not silent resolutions.

| Pass | Job | Pass if… |
|------|-----|----------|
| **1. Code alone** | Correctness, clarity, local docs for non-obvious choices | Resulting code is self-explanatory; surprises are explained near the code |
| **2. Context** | Fit to OpenSpec / VISION / threat model / these checklists | Behavior matches (or intentionally revises) contracts; no silent discrepancies |

**Do not treat a solid pass 1 as license to skip pass 2.** A locally clear change can
still undercut a VISION claim, disagree with a scenario, or land unjustified debt.

## What you are reviewing

Archivey is a **sync-first, zero-dep-core Python library** for reading, streaming, and
safely extracting archives (ZIP / TAR / ISO / directory / single-file codecs; native
7z/RAR). There is no web UI, SQL/ORM, or HTTP product surface. The CLI is a **wedge
and second consumer** of the library API — useful evidence of API gaps, not the main
act (`VISION.md`).

### Load-bearing claims (rank findings against these)

From `VISION.md` / `review/README.md` — a finding that undercuts a marketing claim
outranks a same-severity nit that does not:

1. **One uniform interface** with honest cost / capability signals (no silent
   per-format guesses).
2. **Safe by default** — zip-slip, symlink escape, and decompression bombs require
   explicit opt-out; safety is a contract, not a flag.
3. **Memory-safe parsing of hostile input** — pure-Python parsers preferred so crafted
   archives cannot *corrupt* native parser memory; failures must be honest errors.
4. **Damaged input is first-class** — recoverable members + an honest error beat a
   bare exception at open (salvage mode is backlog; don’t invent it in a PR review).
5. **≤ ~1.3× stdlib** on common ZIP/TAR open/list/read/extract paths (up to ~2× when
   safety/correctness justifies it). Track **bytes decompressed and seeks**, not only
   wall time — silent solid-block re-decode fails the budget even if a tiny fixture hides it.

### Non-goals (don’t demand these in reviews)

- Async public API in v1
- Compatibility shims for `zipfile` / `py7zr` / `rarfile` APIs
- Quirk-driven architecture that lets third-party reader quirks leak into core contracts
- In-place archive modification / encryption-write for 7z/RAR

## "No surprises" — the standing design rule

Behavior differences between formats must be **data** (`None`, explicit enums,
documented sentinels) — never silent guesses (`openspec/project.md`, `VISION.md`).

When reviewing cross-backend changes, ask:

- [ ] Does every backend give this field the **same meaning**?
- [ ] If a backend cannot provide it, is emptiness / `None` documented and asserted?
- [ ] Would a caller branching on the field trip on a format-specific surprise?
- [ ] Should the declarative corpus / conformance sweep grow an assertion?

Parity hot spots from past reviews: `member.hashes`, `ListingCost` / `AccessCost`,
`MemberStreams` / `StreamCapability`, timestamps/mode/links/`MemberType` (incl. `ANTI`),
duplicate-name / `is_current` semantics.

## Coding and contract checks (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)

**`CONTRIBUTING.md` §Coding standards holds the rule text, and holds it once.** Read it at
the start of a review, not once per finding. What follows is the reviewer's half: which of
those rules PRs in this repo actually break, and how to label a break. Violating one is a
**review blocker**, not a style nit.

- [ ] **Zero-dep core.** Core, native 7z read and RAR metadata import nothing third-party
  at runtime; a new dependency lands as an optional extra matching `packaging-and-extras`;
  optional imports stay lazy at the boundary
- [ ] **Types.** Public API and what feeds it is typed, the `py.typed` story is preserved,
  Pyrefly *and* ty stay clean, and every suppression is specific and reasoned inline
- [ ] **Exception translation.** `ArchiveyError` subclasses via the per-reader translator;
  no catch-all; `OSError` / `KeyboardInterrupt` / `MemoryError` propagate;
  `ArchiveyUsageError` stays outside the archive-error tree
- [ ] **A changed exception type was checked against what catches it upstream** — here a
  type is control flow, and the PR should say what the grep found
- [ ] **Nothing drops or clamps silently** — an over-long read, a seek past a boundary, a
  consumed count
- [ ] **Every policy bound is reachable from `ArchiveyConfig`.** A new `_MAX_…` inside a
  parser or reader is a finding *unless* the constant carries a stated structural reason
  and a spec row, which CONTRIBUTING allows. Check for that reason before filing
- [ ] **Clean-as-you-go, with no unspoken deferral.** A "we'll clean this later" shortcut
  needs an explicit home (PR note, `IDEAS.md`, `review/backlog.md`); an unrecorded one is
  debt
- [ ] **Pause-and-ask** on a real design discrepancy — neither author nor reviewer
  silently picks a winner
- [ ] **Comments** explain *why*, carry no history, point at nothing the diff removed, and
  claim nothing stronger than the code guarantees

### The comment rules need a reviewer, not a checker

Stale and overclaiming comments are the largest finding category in this repo by a wide
margin, and they are deliberately not automated: the wording is what makes them wrong, so a
grep would miss the ones that matter and fire on the ones that do not. Read the comments
*around* every hunk, not only the changed lines.

### Pre-existing bugs — settled, do not re-escalate

A pre-existing bug in the **mechanism the PR is already editing**, where the fix is
proportionate, is in scope and is a normal finding. Do not soften it to "pre-existing, not
this PR's" or route it to the backlog. Being in a touched *file* is not the test. A
**sweep** across files the PR does not touch is the follow-up. The maintainer has ruled
"fix it in this PR" on #342, #344 and #349, and "not in this PR" only where the ask was a
cross-file sweep (#339, #353) — so this one does not need another decision packet.

### Specs

Specs are the best current description of the contract, not holy writ.

- [ ] Not every change needs one. Bugfixes, refactors, tests, tooling and docs polish
  usually do not; a spec delta is for a moving **public or cross-format contract**
- [ ] When a contract does move, the spec and the matching docs move in the **same** change
- [ ] A spec that yields a worse outcome gets **revised**, not worked around — surface it
  instead of contorting the code to satisfy the letter of the doc
- [ ] Open threat-model gaps (`O*`) are not closed by prose alone

## Testing

Rule text: `CONTRIBUTING.md` §Testing standards. Review whether the change *has* the right
tests; do not re-run the suite (`SKILL.md` §6).

- [ ] Behaviour assertions on the public API, plus unit tests for the shared foundations —
  stream primitives, format parsers, the codec layer
- [ ] Corrupt, truncated, encrypted, wrong-password, empty, weird-named and non-seekable
  cases, especially when the change touches readers or translators
- [ ] The declarative corpus / conformance sweep where format×shape coverage matters
  (`testing-contract`)
- [ ] A bug fix has a red–green repro
- [ ] **A new guard, property or inventory test names the mutation it failed against.**
  The PR must say which one was applied. "Passes vacuously", "cannot fail for its stated
  reason" and "the fixture never reaches this path" are the recurring shapes here
- [ ] A finding that depends on extras says which config it needs: `[all]`,
  `[all-lowest]`, `[core-only]`

"No test in the suite catches this" is usually a **strategy** gap — property, fuzz,
fault-injection — not one missing example. Flag thin coverage honestly
(`review/backlog.md` Topic 4).

## Domain checklist

The archive-specific traps, alongside the skill's generic checklist. Where one of these
constrains how code must be written, `CONTRIBUTING.md` carries the rule; this is what to go
looking for. Severity: 🔴 blocking / 🟡 important / 🟢 nit.

### Safety & hostile input

- [ ] Extract paths: traversal, absolute / UNC, null bytes, symlink and hardlink escape,
  never write through a symlink (`threat-model`, `safe-extraction`)
- [ ] Bomb and resource limits: output caps, ratios, entry counts, listing limits — and
  reachable from `ArchiveyConfig` (§Coding and contract checks)
- [ ] Parser bounds: a huge length or count field from a header cannot OOM the process
- [ ] Subprocess arguments are a list, and passwords or key material are absent from logs,
  `repr` and exception messages (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)

### Streaming, cost model, performance

- [ ] Hot paths stream rather than slurp-then-parse, unless the PR justifies it
- [ ] Solid / multi-member access does not silently re-decompress a block, and the cost
  signals still match what the code does (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- [ ] Stored digests (`member.hashes`) preferred over decompress-to-hash where the format
  provides them
- [ ] Perf claims cite bytes and seeks, or an existing `benchmarks/` run

### API & layering

- [ ] Public vs `internal/` boundary respected, and new `__all__` entries are intentional
  (`CONTRIBUTING.md`). The CLI reaching into `internal/` usually means an API gap — see
  `review/api-coherence/`
- [ ] Format backends stay behind the uniform reader contracts
- [ ] Sync-first: no accidental async public API

### Specs & docs (quick)

- [ ] A spec delta only when the behaviour contract moves, and no new OpenSpec change
  demanded for a pure refactor or bugfix (§Coding and contract checks)

### Red flags — worth a grep on any diff

An empty `except:` or a swallowed error · `shell=True` with interpolation · an ad-hoc path
join on an extract destination · a TODO in a production path with no home · commented-out
code · a magic number in a parser · a copy-pasted codec or backend block that should share
a helper · a hardcoded credential.
