  Archivey's review skill: how to review a pull request, a fix round, an OpenSpec
  proposal, a whole-file sweep or a commissioned deep review, and how to post the result.
  Use when: reviewing an archivey pull request or its fixes, reviewing an OpenSpec
    proposal or design doc, sweeping files, a commissioned `review/` brief, a review-loop
    round, or when the user invokes /code-review-skill. Not the builtin /code-review or
    /security-review; this skill reports findings and edits nothing.

# Code Review Skill

This file holds what every review in this repo needs: how to report, the output shape,
verdicts, severity, and how to post. What to *do* depends on what you are reviewing, and
each kind has its own doc (§1). Read this file, then the one doc §1 names for what you
are reviewing, plus `CONTRIBUTING.md` on a first look. Nothing else is required reading.

> Started as a Python-only subset of
> [awesome-skills/code-review-skill](https://github.com/awesome-skills/code-review-skill)
> (MIT). The repo's own rules outgrew it and now live here; the upstream-derived guides
> remain as optional reference (§1), under the original `LICENSE`.

**Invoke it by name: `/code-review-skill`.** A bare `/code-review` is a *builtin* skill —
different output shape, and it will edit code. (Cursor's
[`.cursor/commands/code-review.md`](../../../.cursor/commands/code-review.md) routes
`/code-review` here.)

**Repo default — report findings, edit nothing** unless the user asks. Output is markdown
prose in the three-block shape (§3), never a host-specific findings tool.

**Stop rules**, detailed in §6 and listed here so they survive when a long session trims
this file:

- Edit nothing; the implementer fixes (§6 "Do not fix while reviewing").
- Do not re-run the gates or re-measure what an earlier round recorded; run a command
  only to reproduce or check a claim, and say what you ran.
- Never add the `review` label; your verdict says whether another round is wanted.
- Submit with `event: COMMENT` and carry the verdict in the text; GitHub refuses an
  approval on your own PR.
- End every review body, inline comment and reply with the attribution footer.

## 1. What are you reviewing?

| Reviewing | Read | Why it is separate |
|---|---|---|
| A code PR, first look (round 1, or a reviewer new to the PR) | [`reference/code-pr.md`](reference/code-pr.md) | Two passes — code cold, then context — and the archivey checklists |
| A code PR again, after fixes (round 2 on) | [`reference/fix-round.md`](reference/fix-round.md) | Scope is the fix-diff, not the PR: almost every finding after round 1 comes from the previous round's fix |
| An OpenSpec proposal, delta spec or `design.md` | [`reference/reviewing-proposals.md`](reference/reviewing-proposals.md) | No code tree to read cold, so values first |
| Whole files rather than a diff (a sweep batch) | [`reference/whole-file-sweep.md`](reference/whole-file-sweep.md) | One `SWEPT` marker per file, findings or not |
| A commissioned `review/` brief | [`reference/deep-reviews.md`](reference/deep-reviews.md) | A different deliverable and a baseline you record yourself |

**Also read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) at the start of a first look.**
It holds the coding and testing rules; `code-pr.md` says which of them PRs here break and
does not restate them.

**Authoritative sources — open when a finding touches them:**
[`VISION.md`](../../../VISION.md) (product tie-breaker),
[`openspec/specs/`](../../../openspec/specs/) (capability contracts, revisable when wrong),
[`dev-docs/design-rules.md`](../../../dev-docs/design-rules.md) (the maintainer's recurring
rulings, written as rules — check one before calling something a maintainer decision),
[`dev-docs/threat-model.md`](../../../dev-docs/threat-model.md) (the security design: trust
boundaries and open design gaps), [`review/README.md`](../../../review/README.md)
(deep-review conventions; open reviews are the top level of `review/`).

**Lessons already written down — read for every format the change touches:** its
handbook page in [`dev-docs/formats/`](../../../dev-docs/formats/) (§5 Sharp edges,
§6 Decisions) and [`dev-docs/known-issues.md`](../../../dev-docs/known-issues.md). A
change that repeats a recorded trap, or contradicts a recorded decision without saying
so, is a finding.

**Optional guides**, archivey-scoped — open one only when a finding needs it:
[Architecture](reference/architecture-review-guide.md) ·
[Performance](reference/performance-review-guide.md) ·
[Security](reference/security-review-guide.md) ·
[Common bugs](reference/common-bugs-checklist.md) ·
[Error handling](reference/cross-cutting/error-handling-principles.md) ·
[Concurrency](reference/cross-cutting/async-concurrency-patterns.md).
The fill-in report form is [`assets/pr-review-template.md`](assets/pr-review-template.md).

## 2. Finding discipline

Archivey reviews optimize for **maximum code quality with a human maintainer as the
filter** — not for an automated gate minimizing false positives. So **over-report on
existence, be rigorous on labeling.** Raise the concern; never suppress a real one
because you're unsure. The discipline is honest labeling, not silence.

The two-axis + reclassification model below is richer than any host's findings schema,
which is why the output is prose. Posting to a PR → §6.

### Two axes: severity ≠ confidence

Rate every finding on both axes so the maintainer reads **severity × confidence** and
decides:

- **Severity** — impact *if the finding is real*: 🔴 `[blocking]` / 🟡 `[important]` /
  🟢 `[nit]` (plus 💡 / 📚 / 🎉 non-blocking). Mapping for this repo: §5.
- **Confidence** — `CONFIRMED` (you traced the actual failing path: definitions, callers,
  guards) / `PLAUSIBLE` (real risk, not fully traced or no repro built) / `DISPROVEN` (you
  traced it and the code is correct — **route it, don't delete it**).

Low confidence lowers the *confidence tag*, never the decision to report: a
🔴 `PLAUSIBLE` finding is still reported.

**`CONFIRMED` means quoted:** the finding quotes the lines that fail, from the reviewed
HEAD. An absence found only by grep ("nothing calls this", "no backend sets it") is
`PLAUSIBLE` at most, because the lazy `__getattr__` exports in `archivey/__init__.py` and
`BackendRegistry` lookups hide uses from a grep. Say what you searched.

### Verification routes findings; it never silently culls them

After the code + context passes, re-trace each candidate against the actual path —
definitions, callers, guards — rather than pattern-matching. Tracing changes the tag and
may *reclassify* — it does not delete real concerns. When a finding comes back `DISPROVEN`,
ask *"why did I, reading carefully, think this was broken?"*:

- A careful reader could reasonably have misread it → the code isn't self-documenting.
  Re-file as 🟡 **clarity / doc-debt** (`code-pr.md`'s documentation-debt rule) — a comment,
  clearer name, or an `assert` that encodes the invariant.
- Tracing revealed a genuine but non-obvious invariant → 💡 / 📚: suggest the comment or
  assertion that would have made it obvious.
- A careless misread ordinary attention would have avoided → drop it; a 🟢 nit is fair if
  it still cost real review effort.

Only a careless self-misread is ever dropped. Everything else becomes a (possibly smaller)
finding.

### Failure scenario: requested, not gating

Name a concrete trigger where you can — input / archive / state → wrong result, crash, or
contract violation. `CONFIRMED` + repro ⇒ flag it as a **red–green regression-test
candidate** (CONTRIBUTING wants red–green for bug fixes; `code-pr.md` §Testing). Can't
build one → the finding still stands, tagged `PLAUSIBLE` / needs-repro. A missing repro
lowers confidence, never existence.

### Keep findings disciplined (inside block 2)

Over-reporting fails only when it is *unlabeled*. Hold the noise down by discipline, not
suppression:

- **Dedupe by root cause** — one finding per cause; cite one site, list the rest.
- **Rank** by severity, then confidence within a tier.
- Briefing (block 1) stays thin and carries the index; detail lives in each finding's own
  thread (block 2); decisions (block 3) stay only what needs you.

## 3. Output shape — three blocks (required)

Three blocks, and **they do not all go in the same place.** Blocks 1 and 3 are the review
body; block 2 is the inline threads, one per finding (§6). The body is therefore a
summary with an index, and the detail sits on the line it concerns, where it can be
replied to and resolved (maintainer decision, davitf, 2026-09-21).

The maintainer often has **not** read the diff: design the body for that reader, and the
thread for the implementor. [`assets/pr-review-template.md`](assets/pr-review-template.md)
is the fill-in form.

**Every posted comment opens with a header carrying the round and the verdict** — review
body, inline finding and reply alike. Exact shapes: §6 "Open every comment with a header".

**No tables in anything you post.** They wrap into unreadable columns on a phone, which is
where the maintainer reads them. Bullets instead, one per row. This is about *posted*
comments: the tables in this file and in the rest of the repo are unaffected.

**Brevity fence.** Short form applies only to how blocks 1 and 3 are *presented*. It must
not reduce review depth (the full passes in the review type's doc, and the values check
where the change moves a contract; same tracing and checklists), finding discipline
(over-report on existence; severity × confidence), the specificity of a finding **in its
thread**, or real pause-and-ask items in block 3 — when unsure whether something needs a
human call, include it and label confidence. If block 1 is short because the analysis was
thin, that is a failed review, not compliance with this shape.

#### 1. Maintainer briefing (read this first)

For the maintainer skimming without the code open. Half a screen unless the change is huge.

- **What this change is** — 2–4 sentences: intent, main files/areas touched, behaviour
  delta, in plain language. Assume no familiarity with the PR or the OpenSpec change name.
  **Once per PR, not once per reviewer.** Write it only if no review on this PR carries one
  yet, whoever wrote that one; any later review opens with the status bullets over the
  existing IDs (`fix-round.md`) instead. The one exception is a rework that made the
  earlier description wrong: then give one line on what changed. (Fix-diff scope stays
  per *reviewer*: a reviewer new to the PR reads `main...HEAD`.)
- **Findings** — the index, and the only list of findings in the body. One bullet each,
  ranked by severity then confidence, including 🟢 and 💡: ID, severity, confidence, the
  gist in one sentence, the location, and a link to the thread. Nothing else. The full
  finding is in the thread, and a body that repeats it is the length problem this shape
  exists to fix. **Post the inline comments first, then the body**, because a review
  submitted in one call creates both at once and the body would have no URLs to link to
  (`POST .../pulls/{n}/comments` returns each comment's `html_url`, and §6 records that
  a review body cannot be edited afterwards through the MCP tools). A finding whose thread
  URL you genuinely cannot get is listed with its `file:line` alone rather than held back.
- **Snapshot** — one line: size (approx. lines / small|medium|large), the scope you
  reviewed, and gates (CI status, §6). The verdict is already in the header, so the
  Snapshot does not restate it.
- **Pass 1 (cold)** — first look at a code PR only: one line naming what the code alone did
  not explain before you opened the PR body or the design, each with its finding ID, or
  `nothing`. It makes the cold read checkable; the rule and why it exists are in
  [`code-pr.md`](reference/code-pr.md) §Pass 1.
- **What's fine** (optional, 1–3 bullets) — load-bearing things that looked correct, so the
  briefing isn't only negatives. Put it inside the collapsed block (§6) rather than in the
  running text.

Zero findings worth action? Say so here and keep blocks 2–3 minimal (`None.`).

#### 2. Implementor handoff (goes on the PR)

For whoever fixes or replies. **This block is not text in the review body — it is the
inline threads**, one per finding, anchored on the line it concerns (§6). The body carries
only the index from block 1.

Write each thread to be read months later by someone who has only that thread in front of
them: the finding's own header (§6), then what is wrong, why it matters, the fix
direction, and the trigger. No "as above" / "see the briefing" / "see K3" — a thread that
points at another comment is unreadable the moment someone opens it from a notification.

**A finding with no location stays in the body**, under the index and in full, still with
its ID: process, missing coverage, contract drift across documents. Those are the exception
and they are usually few; when they are not, the body grows and that is correct.

Standing alone is about surviving that split, not about being carried elsewhere: the PR is
the only destination, and nothing here is written for anyone to take away (the rule is under
block 3 below).

**Evidence, not prose.** Each finding carries severity, confidence, location (`file:line`),
what's wrong, why it matters, fix direction, and a trigger / repro note where possible
(`CONFIRMED` + trigger ⇒ red–green candidate, `CONTRIBUTING.md` §Testing standards). Don't
restate the diff, narrate your process, or pad with transitions. Terse is not thin:
cutting evidence to look brief violates the brevity fence, cutting prose does not.

Every finding gets a thread, 🟢 nits and 💡 suggestions included. Ranking happens in the
index; a thread is ranked by where it sits in the file.

#### 3. Maintainer decisions (your attention)

**Only** items that need a human call — this block is the maintainer UI; block 2 is worker
mail for whoever addresses the PR. Use the canonical decision packet in
[`dev-docs/pair-workflow.md`](../../../dev-docs/pair-workflow.md) §Decision packet —
same six fields, same cold-start test. Do not invent a shorter parallel list. Routine
"please add a test for X" fixes belong in block 2. Nothing to decide → `None.` Do not
invent filler questions, and do not drop a real decision gap to keep the section empty.

Posting for a split implementor/maintainer workflow: blocks 1–2 go on the PR; if you also
chat with the maintainer, send **block 3 packets only** unless they ask for the full
handoff.

**The posted review is the whole handoff — do not also write a prompt for the implementing
agent.** No “paste this into a fresh agent” brief, no prompt file, no second copy of the
findings in chat or in a scratch document. The implementing agent runs
[`address-review-findings`](../address-review-findings/SKILL.md) and reads the PR
threads itself, so the copy is redundant on the day it is written and wrong a round later,
when a thread has been replied to and the copy has not. Block 2 stands alone so that it
survives being **split across PR threads** — not so the maintainer has something to carry
to a worker. A fix direction too long for a thread still belongs in the thread.

**A decision the maintainer already settled is no longer a block 3 item.** Move it into
block 2 where the implementor works, marked as theirs and not yours:

> **Maintainer decision (davitf): fix, do not defer.** Nits on this PR are to be closed,
> not carried.

Re-raising a settled call sends the implementor back to the maintainer for an answer that
exists; leaving it unmarked lets it read as reviewer preference, which gets argued with or
skipped. Name the decider and link the comment or packet where there is one. A
recommendation the maintainer has **not** ruled on stays yours, however confident — do not
promote your own preference to "decided" because nobody objected.

**Do not hold the review waiting on a decision that has already been made.** Once every
block 3 packet is settled, the review goes on the PR: a settled decision that lives only
in a chat transcript is lost. The responder's counterpart is
[`address-review-findings`](../address-review-findings/SKILL.md) §6.

Reviewing an OpenSpec proposal (`reviewing-proposals.md`) uses the same three blocks: "what
this change is" summarizes the proposal's intent, and block 2 is the handoff for whoever
revises the proposal or implements it later.

## 4. Verdicts and the round budget

### Verdicts — what each one commits to

The header's verdict is a claim about whether the PR is ready to merge **as it stands**,
so use these meanings and no others:

- **✅ Approve** — nothing left to change. Every finding is `DISPROVEN`, already fixed in a
  later commit, or a 💡 / 📚 / 🎉 annotation that carries no action.
- **✅ Approve, conditional on the listed fixes** — the only remaining findings are 🟢 nits
  (or a 🟡 that small) whose fix is *obvious*, and you would not need to see the result. Say
  which IDs the approval is conditioned on, in the heading itself. This is the one
  verdict that approves with work outstanding; the conditioned findings are still posted in
  full (block 2, inline threads, IDs) — approving is not shorthand for dropping them.
- **💬 Comment** — findings the implementor should act on, but nothing the maintainer must
  decide and nothing you need to re-review.
- **🔄 Request Changes** — a 🔴 stands, or a fix needs a look once it lands.

**"Only nits left" is not a reason to merge.** In this repo a 🟢 nit is *small*, not
*optional*: it gets fixed before merge, on this PR. "Leave it for a follow-up" is not an
available disposition — nobody comes back for it, and the next agent has no memory of this
round (`CLAUDE.md`). So never write "good to merge, only nits remain": either the nits are
fixed, or the verdict is the conditional approval above, which keeps them on the
implementor's list. Only the maintainer waives a nit, explicitly; when they do, record it
per the settled-decision rule in block 3.

The 💡 / 📚 / 🎉 tiers are the genuinely optional ones — they propose or teach, they do not
ask for a change, and they never hold a merge.

### Round budget — from round 3, nits do not hold the PR

**From the third round on, if only 🟢 nits remain open, the verdict is
"✅ Approve, conditional on the listed fixes" and you stop reviewing.** Do not open a
fourth round to confirm wording changes you already described. Whether it then merges
follows `AGENTS.md` §Working with the maintainer: an agent may merge a straightforward PR
once the review approves and CI is green, and a tricky one goes to the maintainer. This
bounds re-reading, not merging.

This is not a relaxation of the nit rule — the conditioned findings are still posted in
full and still fixed. It is a bound on *re-reading*: late rounds find almost only 🟢
wording, and part of that is churn an earlier fix on the same PR created.

A round 3+ that finds a 🔴 or a 🟡 is a normal round — say so and keep going. The budget
binds only the case where the remainder is nits.

**Under the automated loop the verdict is what stops the loop**, not a suggestion it
weighs — and unlike the budget above it, that is not a round-3 rule: a conditional
approval at round 1 ends the loop at round 1. The round's verdict file maps 🔄 Request
Changes to a closing comment that asks for another round, and the three "I do not need
to see the result" verdicts — a plain approval, the conditional approval above, and
💬 Comment — to one that asks for none, whatever rounds the cap has left
([`dev-docs/review-loop.md`](../../../dev-docs/review-loop.md) §Stopping it). So the
verdict line is a decision about spending another review, and writing 🔄 to keep a round
in hand spends one on wording you have already described.

## 5. Severity

🔴 `[blocking]` must fix · 🟡 `[important]` should fix, discuss if you disagree ·
🟢 `[nit]` small, but still fixed on this PR — *small*, not *optional*.
Non-blocking annotations: 💡 `[suggestion]` · 📚 `[learning]` · 🎉 `[praise]`.
Pair each finding with a confidence tag — `CONFIRMED` / `PLAUSIBLE` / `DISPROVEN` (§2).

| Label | Archivey examples |
|-------|-------------------|
| 🔴 `[blocking]` | Path escape on default extract; catch-all exception translation; core grows a hard dep; unjustified type suppressions; silent solid O(n²) on a common API; deliberate new debt with no recorded decision; public contract change left undocumented *and* undiscussed |
| 🟡 `[important]` | Dishonest cost signal; format parity hole without docs; missing red-green test for a bugfix; threat-model gap touched but unaddressed; CLI forced to import `internal/`; code contorted to match a questionable spec without raising a revision; non-obvious logic that only makes sense after reading OpenSpec/`design.md`/long PR prose (pass-1 doc debt, `code-pr.md`) |
| 🟢 `[nit]` | Naming, comment polish, non-user-facing refactor suggestions — *small*, not *optional*: still fixed on this PR (§4) |
| 💡 / 📚 / 🎉 | Alternatives, teaching notes, praise — non-blocking |

When unsure whether something is 🔴 vs 🟡: **does it undercut a VISION claim or the
error/safety contract?** If yes → 🔴.

## 6. Posting the review to a pull request

The usual workflow here is that **a second agent posts this review to the PR, and the
implementing agent then works through it** (`.claude/skills/address-review-findings/`).
That handoff is the reason for the rules below: a review that reads well in a terminal but
cannot be dispositioned finding-by-finding costs the next round more than it saved.

### Stable IDs, one thread per finding

- **Give every block-2 finding a stable ID and keep it across re-reviews** — a re-review
  of `F3` says `F3`, not `2`. The responder's status list and the maintainer's memory
  both key on them; renumbering between rounds silently breaks both.
- **Prefix the ID with your own initial** (`K1`, `K2`, … from Claude Code) rather than a
  bare `F`, so IDs from different reviewers on one PR never collide. Keep counting up
  across your own rounds on that PR — `K7` follows `K6` even in a later round.
- **Post each block-2 finding that has a `file:line` as an inline review comment** anchored
  there, not buried in one long top-level wall. Inline findings can be replied to and
  resolved individually, which is what makes the state of a round visible later.
- **Post blocks 1 and 3 as the review body** (or a top-level comment): the maintainer
  briefing and the decisions are about the change as a whole and have no line to anchor to.
  The body's finding list is the **index only** — one bullet per finding, linking to its
  thread (§3). Do not also paste the findings into it.
- Findings without a location — process, missing coverage, contract drift across documents
  — stay in the top-level body, still with IDs, and there they are written in full.

Where the host cannot post inline comments, one top-level comment is acceptable, but the
IDs are not optional.

### Open every comment with a header

A footer is only visible once the reader reaches the end, and a comment that opens with
prose gives the reader nothing to decide from until they have read it. So **every** posted
comment — review body, inline finding, reply — opens with a markdown heading, then one
attribution line.

The heading answers "do I care about this one?" before anything else. On the review body
it carries the **round and the verdict**; on a finding it carries the ID, severity and
confidence, which are that finding's verdict. Maintainer decision (davitf, 2026-09-21).

**Review body:**

```
## Round 2 · 🔄 Request Changes

**Claude Code** · `code-review-skill` · `3060ac51` · scope `9f21ab4..3060ac51`
```

Conditional approval names what it is conditioned on in the heading itself:
`## Round 3 · ✅ Approve, conditional on K7, K9`.

**Inline finding:**

```
### K6 · 🟡 `[important]` · `CONFIRMED`

**Claude Code** · `code-review-skill` · round 2 · `3060ac51`
```

**Reply on a thread:**

```
### K6 · still open

**Claude Code** · `code-review-skill` · round 3 · `f65b6d05`
```

Use `## ` in a review body and `### ` in an inline comment or reply. The level is what
keeps the raw markdown readable, and it nests a finding's heading under the body's.

Agents post through the maintainer's account, so the avatar says `davitf` on most
threads; the header is what makes them scannable. Keep the attribution to one line; the
detail belongs under it.

### Do not re-run the gates — or re-measure what a previous round recorded

The implementer and CI already ran `check.sh` / `test.sh`. A review does **not**
re-run ruff, pyrefly, ty, or the test suite. Glance at CI in logistics (`code-pr.md`) only
enough to know whether failures are in-scope. The Snapshot "gates if known" line
is that status — not a claim you re-ran them.

Run a command only when the review itself needs a result CI cannot give:
reproducing a suspected bug, checking a runtime claim, confirming a "does not
reproduce." When you do, say exactly what you ran. A "does not reproduce" with
no command is still a copied claim.

**The same rule applies to your own earlier rounds.** Rebuilding a fixture, re-timing a
bomb, re-running a mutant, or re-deriving an offset that a previous round already
established is the largest measured waste in this loop.

So **close every review body with a `Measured this round` list** — one line per command,
with its result. **It is written for the next round, not for the maintainer, so collapse
it**, along with the other next-round material: "What's fine", and the outward-trace note.
GitHub renders `<details>` as a one-line disclosure triangle, so the data survives at no
cost to the reader who does not want it:

```
<details><summary>Measured this round · what's fine · outward trace</summary>

- `python scripts/make_7z_bomb.py --members 70000` → 2.1 s, 4.4 MB header
- `pytest tests/test_sevenzip_limits.py -k bcj2` → 12 passed, RESTART BLOCKS SEEN: [0]

</details>
```

The blank lines inside the block are required — GitHub does not render markdown flush
against the tags. Nothing a decision depends on goes in here: findings, the verdict and
block 3 stay in the open text.

The next round inherits that list and re-runs only what the new HEAD invalidates. When
you do re-run something, say what changed to make it necessary. An empty list is a
perfectly good answer and should be written as `None.`

**CI not posted** (unpushed, or still running): the Snapshot line says
`gates: CI pending`. Don't infer a result, don't stand in for CI — ask the author
to push.

**Exception — commissioned `review/` briefs** (`deep-reviews.md`): baseline first still
holds. No CI run to inherit, and the skip count is itself evidence.

### You cannot post a GitHub approval — expected, not news

Agents here post through the maintainer's own account, and GitHub refuses
`event: APPROVE` on your own pull request:

```
422 Unprocessable Entity — Can not approve your own pull request
```

This is the normal, permanent state of this repo's review loop, not a failure to report.
So:

- **Submit the review with `event: COMMENT`** (`pull_request_review_write`, method
  `submit_pending`). `REQUEST_CHANGES` is rejected on your own PR for the same reason —
  `COMMENT` is the only event that goes through.
- **Carry the verdict in the text**, where the header already puts it. The
  briefing's `✅ Approve` / `✅ Approve conditional on K4, C5` / `🔄 Request Changes` is the
  review's actual conclusion; the green check in GitHub's UI is not available to say it.
- **Do not narrate the limitation** to the maintainer as a discovery each round, and do not
  retry `APPROVE` to see if it works this time. If it is worth a line at all, it is one
  clause in the handoff ("verdict in text; GitHub blocks self-approval"), not a paragraph.
- A human approval, where the repo's checks require one, is still the maintainer's to give.
  Nothing you post substitutes for it.

### Attribution footer

Every review body, inline comment and reply ends with the attribution footer, written by
you — `\n\n---\n_Generated by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)_` in Claude Code. Do not
count on the posting path to add it: the current paths append nothing, and a review body
posted without it cannot be edited afterwards through the MCP tools. The rule and why:
`AGENTS.md` §Review workflow.

### The `review` label is a command

Adding the `review` label to a pull request starts a review round
([`review-loop.md`](../../../dev-docs/review-loop.md)). A reviewer never adds it: whether
another round is wanted is what your verdict says, and the implementer acts on it.

### Name the responder skill in the review body

End block 3 with a one-line pointer to the responder skill:

```
Addressing these: `.claude/skills/address-review-findings/SKILL.md`.
```

A session reacting to the review as a PR *event* never invokes a skill nobody named, so
this line is the only thing in the PR that says which process applies.

### Do not fix while reviewing

`/code-review-skill` reports; it does not edit (the repo default above). Leaving the fix to
the implementing agent is what keeps the review a second opinion rather than a self-graded
one.
