  Relentless design interview that records decisions as light notes on living
  handbook pages (dev-docs/formats/*, dev-docs/topics/*), not a new ADR per choice.
  Use when: sharpening a plan before implement, "grill me", grill-with-docs,
  aligning on a format or cross-cutting design, or when the user invokes

# Grill with handbook

Sharpen a plan or design with the maintainer until assumptions are explicit, then
**write the conclusions into the living handbook**. Create
`dev-docs/formats/<format>.md` or `dev-docs/topics/<topic>.md` **when this change needs
it** — do not invent empty handbook trees ahead of content. Full loop:
[`dev-docs/pair-workflow.md`](../../../dev-docs/pair-workflow.md).

Inspired by Matt Pocock’s grill / grill-with-docs / domain-modeling skills; adapted so
archivey’s source of truth is organised handbook pages, not an append-only ADR log.

## Rules

1. **Facts are your job.** Run commands, read code, spawn explore subagents. Never ask the
   maintainer for something you can measure.
2. **Rules first, then decisions.** Check
   [`dev-docs/design-rules.md`](../../../dev-docs/design-rules.md) before asking: a fork a
   rule settles is not a question, so apply the rule and name it. Put each fork no rule
   settles to the maintainer with a recommendation.
3. **One question per turn.** Ask the most blocking unblocked question and wait for the
   answer before the next, as everywhere else in this repo (`AGENTS.md` §Working with the
   maintainer). You may list the titles of the questions still open so the maintainer
   sees what is coming.
4. **Do not implement** during the grill unless they explicitly end grilling and ask to
   build.
5. **Prefer handbook over new ADRs.** Mint `dev-docs/decisions/NNNN-*.md` only for rare
   repo-wide policy that will not fit a format/topic page.

## Round format

```
❓ **Q1** — **<title>**: <body; options if useful>

➡️ Recommendation: <your answer>

Still open after this: Q2 <title> · Q3 <title>
```

## Where to write (when a decision settles)

| Kind | Write to |
| --- | --- |
| Format behaviour / consequences | `dev-docs/formats/<format>.md` — create if missing; follow pair-workflow §Format page structure (`zip.md` is the worked example) |
| Cross-cutting behaviour | `dev-docs/topics/<topic>.md` — same; **link** the relevant `threat-model.md` section, never restate the threat model (its old `O*` ids are only an index now) |
| Glossary / overloaded term | Short **Terms** subsection on the relevant format/topic page |
| Heavy evidence | New or updated file under `dev-docs/investigations/`; link from the handbook page |
| Irreversible repo-wide policy | ADR under `dev-docs/decisions/` (exception path) |

If neither handbook tree exists yet, creating the first page (and optional index README)
in this change is correct. Record decisions as **light bullets**: *choice → why →
rejected alternative*.

Until a page exists for this scope, put interim conclusions in the thin brief and name
the handbook file you will create when implementing.

## Done when

- Frontier empty: no silent assumptions left for this scope.
- Handbook page created/updated, or explicitly deferred with a one-line “TODO page” in the
  thin brief.
- You can draft a **thin brief** (goal, non-goals, handbook/ADR links, verify commands)
  and the maintainer agrees you share an understanding.

Then stop. Implementation is a separate step in the pair workflow.
