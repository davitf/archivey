"""Look for inputs that crash rapidgzip's decoders when they run in-process.

archivey runs rapidgzip in a child process for every codec it decodes (gzip, zlib, raw
DEFLATE and bzip2; ``src/archivey/internal/streams/codecs/rapidgzip_child.py``), so a
crash in its C++ code costs one stream and not the caller's program. This script answers
whether that isolation is still needed: it runs the decoders **in-process**, the way a caller
without archivey would, on damaged input, and reports every crash by its signature.

- DEFLATE family (gzip, zlib, deflate): rapidgzip 0.16 aborts on a stream that ends
  early (``dev-docs/known-issues.md`` Bug 4). That signature is listed as known, and so
  is an abort with no message on an input the standard library reads as ending early.
  Windows writes no message at all, so there an abort on any input the standard library
  does not read cleanly is filed as known too; the Linux and macOS runs, which see the
  message, are the ones that can name a new DEFLATE crash. When a run with cut inputs
  no longer finds it, the abort may be fixed upstream.
- bzip2 (``rapidgzip.IndexedBzip2File``): no crash has been seen. Any crash is new.

How it works. Each case is a valid stream (payload shape, size and compression level
picked from the seed), then one mutation: a cut, flipped bits, an overwritten, deleted
or repeated range, appended bytes, or none. Files given with ``--corpus`` are mutated
too. A worker process decodes the cases one after another with rapidgzip, from an
``io.BytesIO`` or from a path, reads to the end (at most ``_OUTPUT_CAP`` bytes), seeks
back and reads again. This process watches the worker: a worker that dies during a
case is a crash, and one that does not answer in ``--timeout`` seconds is a hang. The
case is saved to ``--out``, the worker is restarted, and the search goes on. Python
exceptions are the expected outcome for damaged input and are only counted.

The cases are deterministic for a given ``--seed``, so a crash reproduces with
``--replay FILE``, which decodes one saved input in a watched worker.

Usage::

    uv run --no-sync python scripts/accelerator_crash_search.py
    uv run --no-sync python scripts/accelerator_crash_search.py --codec bzip2 --seconds 600
    uv run --no-sync python scripts/accelerator_crash_search.py --codec gzip --cases 200 \\
        --out crashes/ --json-out crash-search.json
    uv run --no-sync python scripts/accelerator_crash_search.py --codec bzip2 \\
        --replay crashes/bzip2-0123abcd.bin

Exit status: 0 when every crash and hang found has a known signature, 1 when one does
not (``--fail-on any`` also fails on known ones), 2 for a usage error. The workflow
``.github/workflows/accelerator-crash-search.yml`` runs it on Linux, macOS and Windows.
