"""Census the content-probe residual on a real filesystem tree.

`brotli-probe-framing-gate` landed the first-block framing check;
`probe-completeness-gate` cut the residual further; `probe-provenance-unconfirmed`
keys the `format_unconfirmed` channel on probe-only provenance (any confidence).
This script measures what is left: how often a content probe still claims a file
that is not that format, which probe claims it, at what confidence, whether
anything corroborated the claim, and therefore whether a later decode failure
carries an unconfirmed signal.

It answers three questions the follow-up changes rest on:

1. **How big is the residual after the gates?** Every probe hit is decoded to
   completion with the real codec, so a genuine `.br` file is counted as genuine
   rather than inflating the false-positive count. That distinction matters: a
   real tree has both.
2. **How much of it is invisible?** After provenance, an uncorroborated probe hit
   stamps at any confidence. Corroborated hits (matching extension, inner-TAR
   upgrade) correctly stay silent. Whether a given file would stamp is read from
   the library's own predicate rather than restated here, so this column can
   still report a regression instead of echoing one.
3. **What would a completeness rule buy?** When a file is no larger than the peeked
   prefix, the probe can see all of it, so tolerating "ran out of input" is unsound: a
   complete valid stream must terminate cleanly. The script reports how many
   fabrications that rejects and, critically, how many genuine streams it would cost.
   (Shipped in `probe-completeness-gate`; the column remains for regression.)

Read-only: opens files, reads at most `DETECTION_LIMIT` bytes for the probe, and reads
whole files only to verify genuineness. Nothing is written or modified.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/exploration/probe_residual_census.py [ROOT ...]

Defaults to a few standard system roots. `uv run` matters — the probes need the
optional `brotli` decoder to be importable, and the verification step needs it too.
