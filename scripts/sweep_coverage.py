"""Count codebase-sweep coverage from the `SWEPT` markers on #315.

The sweep is a cold whole-file reading pass over `src/`, run in batches, posting its
findings as review threads on
[#315](https://github.com/davitf/archivey/pull/315). Coverage used to be counted by
eyeballing those threads, and it was wrong twice in a row — 24% and then 35% against a
truth of 12% and 23% — because a file with no findings looks exactly like a file nobody
opened. Both snapshots also counted fifteen maintainer questions as sweep output.

So a sweep now posts one top-level comment per file it finishes, whose first line is a
machine-readable marker (the shape lives in
`.claude/skills/code-review-skill/reference/whole-file-sweep.md`):

    **SWEPT** `src/archivey/internal/backends/zip_reader.py` — pass=S1 date=2026-09-17 \
lines=1612 findings=3 ids=S1-F1,S1-F2,S1-F3 reviewer=cursor head=94468bd

This script reads those lines and reports coverage against the tree it is run in. It
takes whole comment bodies and ignores everything that is not a marker, so you can pipe
the #315 comments in unfiltered:

    gh api --paginate repos/davitf/archivey/issues/315/comments --jq '.[].body' \
      | python3 scripts/sweep_coverage.py

`--paginate` is what makes that correct rather than merely usually correct: the endpoint
serves 100 comments a page, #315 is already past 30 and gains one marker per file swept,
and a truncated fetch loses markers *silently* — the files on the dropped page come back
as unswept and the next batch brief sends an agent over code someone has already read.
Without `gh` — a Claude Code session has none — page explicitly, and raise the range
until the last page prints nothing:

    for p in 1 2 3; do \
      curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/davitf/archivey/issues/315/comments?per_page=100&page=$p" \
      | python3 -c 'import json,sys; [print(c["body"]) for c in json.load(sys.stdin)]'; \
    done | python3 scripts/sweep_coverage.py

Any other route to the comment bodies works too — the script only cares about the marker
lines — as long as it reaches the last page.

    python3 scripts/sweep_coverage.py --markers markers.txt   # from a file
    python3 scripts/sweep_coverage.py --unswept               # list what is left, biggest first
    python3 scripts/sweep_coverage.py --by-pass               # per-batch breakdown

Counting rules, deliberately narrow:

* **The denominator is the tree, not a remembered number** — every `.py` under `src/`, as
  it stands in this checkout.
* **One marker per path counts once.** A re-sweep posts a second marker; the newest `date=`
  wins and the file is still one file. A path that carries two markers from the *same* pass
  is a double post rather than a re-sweep, so it is reported — it cannot inflate the figure,
  but it means two agents read the same file or one posted twice.
* **Lines come from the tree, not from the marker.** `lines=` in the marker records what
  was read then; the coverage figure is about the code that exists now. Where the two
  differ by more than 10% the file is reported as drifted — it was read, but not as it
  stands.
* **A marker whose path is not in the tree** (renamed, moved, deleted) is reported and not
  counted. It needs re-anchoring by hand: a new marker at the new path, carrying the old
  read's fields unchanged plus a final `moved_from=<old path>`. That marker counts the
  file at its new path, and the old path stops being reported as orphaned. A file whose
  code was folded into another is not re-anchored; it stays reported.
* **Threads are never counted.** Nothing in here looks at findings to decide coverage;
  `findings=` is carried through for the per-batch report only.
* **`ids=` is opaque.** It must be present, and that is all. Batches have used more than one
  ID form and a posted ID is never renumbered, so do not add a check that IDs start with the
  `pass=` value — it would fire on correct history.
