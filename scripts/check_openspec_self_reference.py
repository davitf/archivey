"""Assert no spec prose refers to "this change".

A delta requirement body is written inside a change directory, where "this change" is
unambiguous. `openspec archive` then folds that body into `openspec/specs/`, where it is
not: the change has moved to `openspec/changes/archive/` and a reader of the authoritative
spec has no way to tell which one was meant. Nine such phrases had accumulated across
`format-detection`, `cli`, `safe-extraction` and `error-handling` before anyone counted.

Most of them turned out not to be worth naming, either — they were pre-merge arguments
("this change is a strict increase in what is stamped", "it SHALL ship anyway because…")
whose other referents, the prior behaviour and the pre-change tree, are gone too. So the
rule is not "name the change": it is that the spec states the contract as it stands, and
the reasoning behind it lives in the change's `design.md`, which `openspec/config.yaml`
rules.specs already says.

Two places are checked, for the same reason:

  - `openspec/specs/` — permanent text, so any occurrence is already wrong.
  - `openspec/changes/<id>/specs/` — becomes permanent on archive, so an occurrence here
    is the same defect with a delay. `PENDING` below grandfathers the changes that carried
    one when this check landed; each entry must go before that change archives, and the
    check fails if an id in `PENDING` has become clean, so the list cannot rot.

`design.md`, `proposal.md` and `tasks.md` are not checked: none of them is archived into
the specs, and "this change" is exactly the right phrase there.

Also runnable by hand:
