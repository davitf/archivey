# Build RARLAB UnRAR (the freeware decompressor, not the trialware writer) from
# a pinned GitHub mirror of the published source, and install the `unrar` binary.
#
# Why this exists: Homebrew disabled the `rar` cask on 2026-09-01 because the
# official macOS binaries fail Gatekeeper notarization. Compiling from source
# produces a local binary CI will actually run. archivey's finder requires the
# RARLAB banner — `unar` / `unrar-free` / `7z` are not substitutes.
#
# Source: https://github.com/pmachapman/unrar (one-person mirror of rarlab
# UnRAR source). We fetch a pinned commit with git so the SHA is
# content-addressed; GitHub's generated archive tarballs are not used.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/install-rarlab-unrar.sh --dest DIR [--cache-dir DIR]
#
# Writes DIR/unrar. No-ops if that path already reports the RARLAB banner.

# The RARLAB banner is what archivey's finder actually requires, so it is the
# test for "is this binary the right one" on every path through this script —
# including a DEST restored from a GHA cache, which this script did not produce.
# `-x` is a weaker claim than it looks: it reports the mode bits, and `cp` gives
# the destination the source's mode, so a copy interrupted partway leaves a
# truncated file that is still executable and still passes `-x`.
#
# Two things below look like they could be simplified. Both are load-bearing;
# please read this before tidying them.
#
# 1. The output is captured, rather than the obvious
#      "$1" | head -n 2 | grep -q UNRAR
#    `head` exits the moment it has its two lines. unrar is still writing (its
#    no-argument usage runs to 62 lines) and is killed by SIGPIPE for writing to
#    a pipe nobody is reading any more — exit 141. `grep` itself succeeded, but
#    `set -o pipefail` at the top of this file makes a pipeline report a failing
#    *member* rather than just the last command, so the whole test comes back
#    false for a perfectly good unrar. This is not theoretical and not a race:
#    the naive form rejects /usr/bin/unrar every time. It would also not show up
#    as a flake — every run would rebuild, the post-build check would reject the
#    result too, and macOS CI would be red permanently.
#
# 2. `|| true` is not defensive noise. The binary's own exit status is data
#    here, not failure: a truncated unrar segfaults (139), and without this
#    `set -e` would kill the script instead of letting the caller reinstall.
#    The `case` below is what decides the answer.
