"""Derive `catalogue-neutral.md` from `catalogue.md` by stripping field 4.

Topic 10's brief (`review/problem-catalogue/brief.md` §Definition of done #4) requires
the redacted view to be *derivable* and committed, so that the fresh-design comparison
in `experiment.md` cannot accidentally be run against the annotated catalogue.

Field 4 ("Answer today") and the per-entry `Sources` list are removed; the id,
category, Problem, Symptom and Evidence survive. Run after editing `catalogue.md`:

    python scripts/derive_neutral_catalogue.py

`tests/test_review_problem_catalogue.py` asserts the committed file matches this
script's output, so the two cannot drift.

**Derived, not authored.** Generated from [`catalogue.md`](catalogue.md) by
`scripts/derive_neutral_catalogue.py`, which strips field 4 ("Answer today") and the
per-entry source list. Edit `catalogue.md` and re-run the script; a test asserts this
file matches its output.

This is the artifact the fresh-design comparison is run against
([`experiment.md`](experiment.md)). It exists as a separate committed file so that
redaction is not a manual step at experiment time — the failure it prevents is handing a
frontier model the annotated catalogue by accident, which would invalidate the whole
exercise.

Each entry states a **problem** the world poses, the **symptom** someone observes, and the
**evidence** that it is real. What any particular library does about it is deliberately
absent. Categories: format quirk · upstream library defect · security / hostile input ·
platform & filesystem · performance & memory · API and usage pattern · packaging &
dependency · concurrency & lifetime.

Entry ids are stable and shared with the annotated catalogue, so a finding against an
entry here can be traced back.
