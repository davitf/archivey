"""Assert every Sphinx cross-reference role in the docstrings renders as intended.

The docstrings use Sphinx roles (``:class:`~archivey.ArchiveMember```), and
mkdocstrings does not understand them. ``scripts/griffe_extensions.py`` rewrites them
into links at build time; before it did, 129 of them reached the published API page as
literal text (``:class:~archivey.ArchiveMember``), and ``mkdocs build --strict`` was
green the whole time. It has nothing to warn about: to Markdown a role is just text.

Two checks over the built site:

**No role leaks as text.** The HTML and the search index (which is what search results
show) must hold no role: a new docstring spelling the extension does not match, a role
written into a page under ``docs/``, or the extension dropped from ``mkdocs.yml``.

**Every role resolves, or is known not to.** The extension emits *optional* autorefs,
and an optional reference that finds no anchor falls back to plain code at DEBUG level,
so ``--strict`` never reports it. A renamed public symbol, or a broken mapping from
defining module to public path, would otherwise turn links into plain code silently.
The extension marks the code it emits with ``class="sphinx-role"``; one that renders
inside ``<span title="target">`` rather than a link did not resolve. Its target must be
in ``UNRESOLVED_OK`` below, and every entry there must still occur, so the list cannot
go stale.

Run after a build:

    uv run --group docs mkdocs build --strict
    python3 scripts/check_docs_rendered.py [site-dir]
