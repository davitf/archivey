"""Dry-run every archive under a directory: statistics, and a list of files to check.

    python scripts/scan_archives.py ~/backups -o scan.csv [--password-file FILE]

Each archive goes through ``extract_all(dry_run=True)``, the real extraction pass with
file bodies discarded, so nothing is kept on disk. Files are found by content, not by
extension; a file ``detect_format`` cannot place is skipped.

Three outputs:

- ``scan.csv``: one short row per archive. The ``flags`` column says why an archive is
  worth a closer look (``bug``, ``open_error``, ``failed_members``, ``over:max_ratio``,
  ``diag:archive_trailing_data``, ...); filter on it. Empty flags means nothing stood
  out.
- ``scan.log``: the detail for every flagged archive (error messages, the members
  that failed, what declared the largest decoder allocation, archivey's own warnings,
  tracebacks), then the summary.
- The summary, also printed at the end: counts by format and outcome, how many
  archives carry each flag and diagnostic, and for every configurable limit the
  largest value seen, the 99th and 50th percentiles, and how many archives are over
  the default or past half of it without being over. Ctrl-C stops the scan and still
  writes the summary for the archives done so far.

**Resuming.** ``scan.progress`` records every file the scan has finished with, archive
or not, and every directory whose whole subtree is done. ``--resume`` continues an
interrupted scan from it: finished directories are not listed again, finished files
are not opened again, and the CSV and log are appended to. The summary covers the
whole scan, earlier rows read back from the CSV. A resume does not look for changes
in what was already scanned; a changed tree is a new scan. The checkpoint and the CSV
hold paths as the root was typed, so a resume must name the root the same way (a
relative root from the same directory); another spelling is refused. Without
``--resume``, the script refuses to start over a scan that has not finished.

- A file or directory that could not be read is logged under ``not read`` and counted
  in the summary. It is not marked done, so a resume tries it again.
- A file that Ctrl-C interrupted is scanned again on resume.
- A file that the process died on (a native crash, the OOM killer, ``kill -9``) is
  scanned once more on resume, since one stop may have had another cause. If the
  process dies on it again, the next resume writes a row for it with the ``crashed``
  flag and goes on.
- A last line cut off mid-write, in the CSV or in ``scan.progress``, is removed on
  resume; that file is scanned again.

**Limits.** By default the scan turns off the limits that only count something (bytes,
entries, ratio, members, metadata, key-derivation rounds, spool), so the columns show
the true value rather than stopping at the cap. The two that protect the scanning
machine, ``max_decoder_memory`` and ``max_ppmd_in_process_input``, stay at their
defaults. ``--default-limits`` scans under the full default config instead.

**Where a dry run says less than a real run.** Two of the divergences the dry run
documents (``extract`` in ``src/archivey/internal/extraction.py`` has the full list)
land on this scan's columns. A link whose target leaves the destination and comes back
through a symlink outside it, or climbs above the directory holding it, is refused in
the scratch tree where a real run could accept it, so ``blocked_members`` can name a
member a real extraction would write. And the scratch tree is one filesystem, so a
hardlink never falls back to a copy: ``bytes_written`` is a floor for
``max_extracted_bytes`` when a real destination spans a mount point.

**Best-effort columns.** ``decoder_memory``, ``kdf_rounds`` and ``spool_bytes`` have no
public API yet. The script reads them by wrapping three internal functions for the
duration of the scan, and ``metadata_bytes`` reads the reader's private listing tracker.
Any of them can stop working when those internals change; the script then prints which
on its ``warning: probes not installed`` line rather than leaving a column silently
empty. ``decoder_memory`` is the largest allocation an archive *declared* that archivey
checks itself; xz and zstd hand the limit to liblzma / libzstd and are not counted.
