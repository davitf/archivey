"""Assert no finished OpenSpec change is left unarchived.

Merging a change does not apply it. The deltas under `openspec/changes/<change>/specs/`
only reach the authoritative `openspec/specs/` when someone runs `openspec archive`.

Three changes in a row (#212, #213, #214) merged complete and unarchived, each time
leaving `openspec/specs/` describing an API or a set of extras that no longer shipped.
The specs are the authority, so any window in which a finished change sits unarchived is
a window where the authority is wrong.

A change is "finished" here on the same terms `openspec list` uses to print
`✓ Complete`: its `tasks.md` has at least one checkbox and every one of them is `[x]`.
Anything else — `[ ]`, or the `[~]` partial marker used in a couple of archived changes —
counts as outstanding, so this errs toward staying quiet.

Runs on pull requests as well as on `main`. The rule it enforces is therefore
**archive in the PR that finishes the change**, which is usually the same PR that
proposed and implemented it. A change that is genuinely still in motion — design moving
under review, or an archive deliberately batched with a sibling change — leaves its
trailing task unchecked and this stays quiet. Checking the last box is the claim that the
work is done; archiving is what makes that claim true.

Also runnable by hand:
