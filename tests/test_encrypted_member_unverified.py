"""``ENCRYPTED_MEMBER_UNVERIFIED``: a partial read under a password no digest checked.

A ZipCrypto password that passes the one-byte header check can be wrong, and then the
member decrypts to readable garbage that only the CRC at EOF notices. A caller who stops
reading before EOF never hears about it, unless this diagnostic fires. It must fire for
exactly that shape and stay silent when the password was checked against a digest.
