"""RAR names whose bytes do not decode stay distinct, as TAR names do.

A RAR5 name that is not valid UTF-8, and a RAR 1.5-4 8-bit name with a byte
windows-1252 leaves undefined, decode with ``surrogateescape``: each such byte is one
U+DC80-U+DCFF character, ``raw_name`` keeps the stored bytes, and extraction escapes
it the shared way (``%FF`` under ``STRICT``/``STANDARD``, the raw byte under
``TRUSTED``). They used to decode with ``replace``, so ``a\\xffq.txt`` and
``a\\xfeq.txt`` both listed as ``a\\ufffdq.txt`` and the first was superseded.

``unrar`` 7.00 reads a RAR5 name only up to its first invalid byte, so both of those
names are ``a`` to it. A read through ``unrar`` must still return each member's own
bytes; the mask is built from the stored bytes (``rar_unrar.unrar_member_view``).
