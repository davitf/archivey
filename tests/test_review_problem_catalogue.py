"""Guardrails for the problem catalogue (`review/problem-catalogue/`, Topic 10).

The catalogue is prose, so almost none of it is testable. Three properties are, and each
one guards a failure that would be invisible on inspection (the redaction property is
asserted from both ends, which is why there are four tests):

1. **The redacted view is derivable and current.** `catalogue-neutral.md` is generated
   from `catalogue.md` by `scripts/derive_neutral_catalogue.py`. The brief's §Definition
   of done #4 wants it committed so redaction is not a manual step at experiment time;
   the hazard of committing a generated file is that it silently goes stale, so this
   asserts it matches its generator.

2. **No entry's fields 1–3 leak the solution.** The catalogue's whole second use is a
   fresh-design comparison run against fields 1–3 alone (`experiment.md`). A problem
   phrased in this library's vocabulary makes that comparison a leading question, and the
   brief names it as the one constraint whose violation silently destroys the artifact.
   The check is a name sweep, not a judgement of voice — the voice is a human review pass
   — but it catches the mechanical half.

3. **Every entry has all four fields.** §Definition of done #2. A missing field 4 is
   allowed only as an explicit statement that the problem is unresolved, which is why the
   assertion looks for the word rather than for the field.
