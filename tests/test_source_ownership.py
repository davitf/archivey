"""archivey never closes a stream the caller handed it.

``archive-reading`` states it as a rule ("Archivey SHALL never close a caller-supplied
``BinaryIO``") and the stream layer keeps it by borrowing rather than owning. Those are
both about *wrappers*, though, and a rule about wrappers can be broken from outside them:
a caller's own object reaching a backend unwrapped is one owning wrapper away from being
closed. ``SeekCountingStream`` is such a wrapper, in the ZIP and compressed-TAR close
chains whenever measurement is on.

So this module tests the rule end to end, at the entry points, over the object the caller
actually passed: every format from a stream, both of the two commonest stream shapes, with
measurement on and off. A per-class ownership decision is checked in
``test_stream_bases.py``; this is the property those decisions exist to produce, and it
holds no matter which wrapper a backend puts in front of the source.

"Not closed" is the weaker half of the claim. Each test also reads from the stream
afterwards: a stream that survives as an object but not as a source is no use to the
caller who still owns it.
