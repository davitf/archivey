"""No raw exception escapes the public API on a wrong argument.

Every finding this file guards was found the same way: call a public entry point with
a value a caller plausibly writes, and look at what comes back. The failures were not
subtle — ``AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'diagnostic_policy'`` from
``config="strict"``, ``LookupError`` from a misspelled ``encoding=``, a silently empty
extraction from ``members="notes.txt"`` — but each was reachable only by making that
one call, and nothing made the whole surface answerable at once.

So the point of this file is the **sweep**, not the individual cases, and it takes two
tests to be one. :func:`test_no_raw_exception_escapes` walks a table of (entry point,
argument, wrong value) and asserts that what escapes is on the contract's list. That
half can only ever check the rows it was handed, so
:func:`test_every_public_argument_is_swept` reads the public signatures back and fails
when an argument has neither a row nor a written exemption — which is what makes an
argument added with no check a failure here rather than a silence.

**What the contract permits**, and therefore what this test allows through
(``error-handling`` and ``archive-reading``):

* :class:`~archivey.ArchiveyUsageError` — a detected caller bug (ADR 0012), outside
  ``ArchiveyError`` so ``except ArchiveyError`` cannot swallow it. The only answer, and
  it must also be a ``TypeError`` or a ``ValueError`` (DR-15), so a caller's
  ``except TypeError`` catches a wrong type as it would anywhere else in Python. That
  holds for **source** and ``dest`` too: ``open_archive(0)`` raises a usage error that
  is a ``TypeError``, never a bare one.
* An empty string as a **source** or ``dest`` is a usage error that is also a
  ``ValueError``: ``Path("")`` is ``Path(".")``, so it would otherwise name the current
  directory. Every path argument must have an empty-string row
  (:func:`test_every_path_argument_has_an_empty_row`), and the sweep requires such a
  row's error to be a ``ValueError`` whose message says the path is empty.
* :class:`~archivey.exceptions.ArchiveyError` — an archive/environment failure, and
  only on a source row, where a wrong-typed value can also be real archive bytes.
* ``TypeError`` for ``len()``/``in``, which this file does not exercise.
* ``KeyError`` for an unknown member name (``archive-reading`` specifies it), plus
  ``io.UnsupportedOperation`` for an unsupported ``seek`` and ``ValueError`` for I/O
  on a closed stream — neither of which this file exercises.

Anything else is a finding. In particular an ``AttributeError`` is **never** allowed:
every one of them here named a private attribute of ours in the message, which is the
"no internal leakage" rule in ``CONTRIBUTING.md``.
