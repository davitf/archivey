"""Second-round audit reproducers for the RAR backend (findings R15 onwards).

Each test states the promised behaviour. A test marked ``xfail(strict=True)`` fails
today for the reason in its marker; it turns green (and so strict-fails) when the bug
is fixed, and the marker must then be removed.

Most archives are derived from committed fixtures by rewriting headers with the
helpers in ``tests/test_audit_rar_iso_dir.py``, so only ``unrar`` is needed at
runtime. The few that need a real writer skip without ``rar``.
