"""The public API's enum arguments accept string spellings, and refuse bad ones loudly.

Two things are under test, and the second is the reason the first exists.

**The contract.** Every ``Enum`` parameter on a public entry point takes the member, its
``value`` or its name, in any case, with ``-`` and ``_`` interchangeable; anything else
raises :class:`ArchiveyUsageError` at the call, naming the spellings that would have
worked.

**The bugs it closes.** The consuming code tests these with ``is``, so before coercion an
unrecognised value was not refused — it silently took the other branch.
``extract(overwrite="skip")`` fell through to REPLACE and deleted the file the caller
asked to keep; ``extract(on_error="stop")`` behaved as CONTINUE and swallowed a
corruption error. Both have a red-green test here.

The collision guards matter more than they look: coercion is only safe while no two
members share a normalized spelling. They fail on the day a new value introduces an
ambiguity, rather than leaving it to resolve silently to the wrong member.
