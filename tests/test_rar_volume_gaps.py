"""A RAR volume set with a volume missing before its end lists every volume present.

Ruled 2026-10-06 ("list everything in all available parts, then raise at the end"),
for a missing middle volume and a missing volume 1 alike: the members whose headers
are in the volumes present are listed, from whichever volume the set is opened;
members wholly inside present volumes read normally; a member whose data runs into
or out of a missing volume raises ``TruncatedError`` when read; and the listing ends
with ``TruncatedError`` naming the missing volumes. In a solid set every member past
the gap raises too, since its data depends on the solid stream through the gap.

``unrar`` 7.00 behaves the same way, measured: opened before the gap, ``unrar t``
tests up to the gap and stops; opened after it, it skips the member continued from
the missing volume ("You need to start extraction from a previous volume") and tests
the rest.
