"""Bug 3 containment: rapidgzip must not abort the process when its caller-owned source
faults mid-decode (``dev-docs/known-issues.md`` Bug 3).

rapidgzip ``std::terminate``s (SIGABRT) when a Python source callback raises while it is
decoding — classically, the caller closes their own source underneath a live accelerator. No
Python ``try/except`` can contain that abort. ``_open_rapidgzip`` wraps a caller-owned source in
``_TrappingSource`` so the fault is swallowed and re-raised by ``_AcceleratorStream`` as a normal
Python exception instead. Each scenario runs in its own subprocess so an abort is contained; the
assertion is that the **untrapped** raw path aborts (documenting the hazard) while archivey's
**trapped** path exits cleanly with a Python-level error.
