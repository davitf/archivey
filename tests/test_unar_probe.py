"""The ``unar`` RAR5 check: a ``unar`` that drops compressed RAR5 members is not used.

Debian and Ubuntu ``unar`` packages before 1.10.8+ds1-10 carry
``CSInputBuffer-bit-string-reading.patch``, which makes ``unar`` write nothing, with exit
0, for about one compressed RAR5 member in 25 (``dev-docs/known-issues.md``). No version
string identifies those builds, so :func:`archivey.internal.external.unar.find_unar`
runs each ``unar`` once on a small archive with such a member and refuses one that does
not write it exactly.

The stand-in tests fake ``unar`` with shell scripts. The last test checks a real
distribution ``unar`` against what CI says to expect of it.

_EXPLANATION = """
What this checks. Debian and Ubuntu patch their unar package with
CSInputBuffer-bit-string-reading.patch. With it, unar writes nothing, and exits 0, for
about one compressed RAR5 member in 25 (dev-docs/known-issues.md, "Debian/Ubuntu unar
1.10.1: some compressed RAR5 members come out empty"). Debian dropped the patch in
1.10.8+ds1-10 (June 2026). Checked 2026-10-01: Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04 and 26.04 still
ship it; Debian 13 is expected to (1.10.8+ds1-9), not confirmed in a container.
archivey runs every unar once on a small archive with such a member and does not use
one that drops it. The CI job sets ARCHIVEY_DISTRO_UNAR to the distribution's unar
and ARCHIVEY_DISTRO_UNAR_EXPECT to "patched" (the check must fail) or "clean" (it
must pass), so a packaging change is noticed instead of silently changing what CI tests.

If the job expected "patched" and the check now passes: the distribution's unar decodes
correctly now. Change that job's expectation to "clean", consider letting Linux CI use
the distribution's unar again instead of building XADMaster 1.10.8 from source
(.github/workflows/ci.yml), and update dev-docs/known-issues.md with the package
version that fixed it.

If the job expected "clean" and the check now fails: the distribution ships a unar that drops
RAR5 members (the patch came back, or a new bug). Confirm with
tests/fixtures/rar/unar_drop__.rar (unar -o - should write 47 bytes), change that job's
expectation to "patched", and record the package version in dev-docs/known-issues.md.
