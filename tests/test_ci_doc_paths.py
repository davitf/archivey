"""The `pull_request: paths:` filter that keeps docs-only pull requests off the code CI.

`ci.yml`, `atheris-fuzz.yml` and `ppmd-native-stress.yml` each carry the same list. A
pull request whose files all fall outside it starts none of the three, and reports no
check from them at all, so a careless edit here shows up as nothing rather than as a
red check. This cannot run GitHub's matcher; it pins the two edits that would break the
scheme silently: the three copies drifting apart, and a doc file that a test reads
losing its re-include (or the re-include moving above the `!` entries, where GitHub's
in-order evaluation would exclude it again).
