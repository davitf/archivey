"""The review workflow's gate, exercised without GitHub.

`scripts/review_loop_gate.py` decides whether adding the `review` label runs a round,
counts the round, and writes the comment that closes it. Everything it needs arrives as
JSON, so the cases that matter — the round cap, a person buying a round past it, a
review that died, a verdict nobody expected — are testable here instead of by labelling
a pull request and watching what happens.
