"""The sweep coverage counter, exercised without GitHub.

`scripts/sweep_coverage.py` turns the `SWEPT` marker comments on #315 into a coverage
figure. It exists because the figure used to be read off thread counts and was wrong
twice running — 24% and then 35% against a truth of 12% and 23% — which left the
repository's largest and most exposed file in the swept column having never been read.

A maintainer tool that is quietly wrong is not caught by anything else: it is not in CI
and its output is a number nobody can eyeball. So the counting rules are pinned here. The
cases that matter most are the ones where a slip would *lower* the count silently, because
that is the direction that sends an agent back over code somebody already read, and the
one where it would raise it, because that is how a file goes unswept while the page says
otherwise.
