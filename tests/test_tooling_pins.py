"""The lint/type toolchain is pinned exactly, and pinned in only one place.

Two properties, both cheap to lose and both invisible until someone else's checkout
disagrees with yours:

1. **Exact pins, not floors.** These tools decide what the gates *report*. A floor lets
   `uv sync --resolution lowest-direct` — the `[all-lowest]` CI leg, and step 2 of
   CONTRIBUTING's three-config rule — resolve a years-old version: `ruff>=0.11.0` gave
   0.11.0, which reported 367 "errors" the current version does not, on an unchanged
   tree. `ruff format` output also changes between versions, so a floor lets one
   contributor reformat the whole repo just by having a newer one.

2. **One source of truth for ruff.** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` resolves its own copy
   through the framework hook path, while `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` runs the
   dev-group copy via `uv run`. Two paths, two versions, silently different formatting.

Deliberately *not* applied to pytest or the optional format libraries: exercising those
across versions is the point of the `[all-lowest]` leg, and their version does not change
whether the tree is considered clean.
