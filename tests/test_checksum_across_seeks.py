"""A member's stored checksum survives seeks that decode the skipped bytes anyway.

ADR 0014: the member verifier hashes from 0 to its furthest read. A seek back keeps the
checksum, and so does a forward seek whose inner decodes the gap anyway (the verifier
reads it itself). Only a read that skips bytes the inner jumped over (a stored member,
an index) loses it. These run the rule end to end through ``open_archive``.
