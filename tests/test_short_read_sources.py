"""Healthy archives opened from a source whose ``read(n)`` legally returns short.

``io.RawIOBase.read(n)`` returns *up to* ``n`` bytes, and real sources use that latitude:
sockets, FUSE mounts, and user-written wrappers all hand back short chunks mid-stream with
no EOF in sight. Fixed-size structure reads used to issue a single ``read(n)`` and read the
short return as EOF — in archivey's own RAR parser, in the stdlib/third-party readers it
delegates to (``zipfile``, ``tarfile``, ``pycdlib``), and in the ``indexed_bzip2`` seek-index
accelerator alike — so a **healthy** archive from such a source was reported as
``CorruptionError`` / ``TruncatedError``. Two layers fix it: the source boundary coalesces
short reads for **both** seekable and non-seekable streams, and archivey's own parsers
and views gather fixed-size structures with ``read_exact``.

Every case compares against a ``BytesIO`` open of the *same bytes*, so it asserts parity
rather than a hardcoded expectation — a format that cannot be built or read in this
environment simply matches on both sides (or skips).
