"""Open an archive and extract all of it in one call, for tests that only care about
extraction.

The library has no one-shot ``extract()`` (ADR 0019): callers write
``with open_archive(source) as reader: reader.extract_all(dest)``. This helper is that
pair of lines, so a test that checks what extraction did doesn't repeat it. Open
arguments go to :func:`archivey.open_archive` and everything else to
:meth:`~archivey.ForwardArchiveReader.extract_all`, so the report's diagnostics are
extraction-only, as a caller's would be.

It also checks, after every run that returned or raised, that no ``.archivey-tmp-*``
staging file is left under the destination: only a hard kill may leave one
(docs/extracting.md), so every extraction the suite runs through here guards that.
