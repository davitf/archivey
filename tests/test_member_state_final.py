"""``ArchiveMember.member_state_final``: whether archivey can still change the member.

It is false while a member handed to the caller can still be updated in place: during a
forward pass, until the pass ends (a later member with the same name can still make it
``is_current=False``), and for a symlink whose target is stored as member data, until
that target has been read. It is true everywhere else.
