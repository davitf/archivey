# Format detection

How `detect_format()` decides what a source is, and why it decides that way. `open_archive`
and `open_stream` run the same detection when the caller passes no `format=`, under the
same budget, so everything here applies to them too.

Three other pages own parts of this, and this page links them rather than repeating them:

- [`prefixed-archives.md`](prefixed-archives.md) owns the SFX scan: the cue, the window,
  the hit validators, and the tail probe that is not shipped.
- [`formats/single-file.md`](../formats/single-file.md) §2.1 owns the codec side of
  content probing: what each probe checks, its lifted memory limits, and the inner-TAR
  probe's per-codec detail. [`formats/brotli.md`](../formats/brotli.md) owns the Brotli
  probe, which is the one with a false-positive history.
- Each format page's §2.1 owns that format's magic and what the magic cannot tell.

## At a glance

- **Six steps, strongest evidence first, and the first match wins.** Near magic → SFX scan
  → far magic → trailer magic → content probes → extension. The whole order is one
  function, `_detect_format_body` in `internal/detection.py`.
- **Detection reads the front of the source, and one fixed block at the end.** The block
  is the last 512 bytes, and only to look for a UDIF `koly` signature on a cheap seek
  (§2.4). No ZIP tail probe is shipped, and the budget has no field for one. An archive
  that is found only from its end, such as a ZIP appended to a JPEG, is not detected.
  `format=ZIP` still opens it.
- **Detection never consumes bytes the backend needs.** A path gets its own handle. A
  seekable stream is put back where the caller left it. A non-seekable stream is peeked
  through the replay prefix that the backend then reads first. A raw pipe handed straight
  to `detect_format` is the exception (§4.3).
- **Every read and decode is bounded**, almost entirely by
  `ArchiveyConfig.detection_budget` (`BALANCED` by default). The probes' positioned reads
  also have a fixed cap of their own (§4.1). The result carries a receipt of what was spent and a list of the steps that did
  not run, with the reason for each.
- **A filename never overrules the bytes.** When they disagree, the bytes win and
  `FORMAT_EXTENSION_CONFLICT` is emitted.
- **`confidence` is provisional and `detected_by` is an open set** (`docs/formats.md`
  §Detection). No behaviour in the library branches on `confidence`.
- **What you might expect and will not find:**
  - A graded evidence record: `FormatInfo` has one confidence and one `detected_by`, not a
    list of candidates.
  - An error on a polyglot: a file that is two formats gets one deterministic answer (§3.1).
  - More formats found under `THOROUGH`. It reads the same window as `BALANCED`, and the
    same 512-byte `koly` block. What changes in behaviour is only how large a source a
    probe hit is re-checked against (§4.1).
  - Any check that a magic hit is more than its bytes: two bytes `1f 8b` are `GZ` /
    `CERTAIN`, and the open fails.

## 1. Shape

Four facts about the problem produce most of the design.

**Evidence comes in strengths, and the strongest kinds are also the cheapest.** An exact
magic at the offset the format specifies costs a 4 KiB read and is rarely wrong. A magic
found by searching a window is weaker, because the search can land on the same bytes inside
something else, and it costs up to 2 MiB. A content probe is a decoder asked "does this
decode?", and a decoder given arbitrary bytes sometimes says yes. A filename is only what
someone called the file. So the steps run in a fixed order from strongest to weakest, and
each weak step sees only what the stronger ones declined. A fixed order is also easy to
read. The tie rule (§3.1) falls out of it, and it answers every source in at most one pass.

**Some formats have no magic worth trusting.** Brotli has none. zlib has a two-byte header
that matches too much text, and LZMA Alone has a properties byte and a dictionary size.
These three are found only by probes, so the probe step exists and gets the most guards
(§2.5). They are also why the far-magic step runs before the probes and not after (§2.3).

**Detection runs before a reader exists, on any source.** The source can be a path, a
seekable stream in the middle of a file, or a pipe that can be read once. So detection must
not consume what the backend needs, must work forward-only on a pipe, and must bound its
own work, because no reader limit applies yet. That gives the prefix workspace (§4.2),
the budget (§4.1), and one forward pass over the prefix. The seek toward the end is the
512-byte UDIF block, and only on a cheap seek (§2.4).

**Filenames are wrong often enough to matter.** A `.tar.gz` that is really a ZIP, a `.cbr`
that is a ZIP, and a `.tlz` that holds LZMA Alone instead of lzip are all common. So the
extension is the last step, and it is used only when every content signal declined.

## 2. The steps

| Step | Evidence | `confidence` | `detected_by` | Bound under `BALANCED` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Near magic | Exact magic inside the first 4 KiB (`DETECTION_LIMIT`) | `CERTAIN` | `magic` | 4 KiB read |
| 2. SFX scan | Leading bytes look like a prefix; a validated archive needle behind it | `PROBABLE` | `sfx_scan` | `min(size, 2 MiB)` read |
| 3. Far magic | Exact magic past 4 KiB (ISO `CD001` at 32 769) | `CERTAIN` | `magic` | 32 774 bytes, once |
| 4. Trailer magic | Exact magic at the start of a fixed block at EOF (UDIF `koly`, 512 bytes) | `CERTAIN` | `magic` | 512 bytes, on a cheap seek |
| 5. Content probes | LZMA Alone, zlib, Brotli decoders accept the bytes | `PROBABLE`, or `GUESS` for weak Brotli | `content_probe` | 1 MiB of decode input for the call |
| 6. Extension | Longest matching suffix in the aggregated map | `GUESS` | `extension` | nothing read |

A near-magic or content-probe match on a single-file compressor is then offered to the
**inner-TAR probe**, which decodes up to 512 bytes and looks for `ustar` at offset 257. A
hit reports the TAR combination (`TAR_GZ`, and so on) as `PROBABLE` / `content_probe`. It
reads at most 1 MiB of compressed input and draws on the same decode allowance as the
content probes (§4.1). A trailer hit is not a compressor, so it is not offered.

The tables that drive steps 1, 2, 4 and 5 come from the backends and the codec descriptors
as data: `MAGIC`, `TRAILER`, `EXTENSIONS`, `SFX_MAGIC`, `SFX_HIT_VALIDATOR` and
`CONTENT_PROBES`, aggregated by `internal/registry.py`. The detector has no per-format
code. A new format becomes detectable when its backend registers, and the detector cannot
disagree with the backend about what the format's magic is.

### 2.1 Near magic

The first 4 KiB is compared against every signature that ends inside it. TAR's `ustar` at
257 is in this set, so a plain tar is `CERTAIN`. zstd has a structural walk as well: it steps
over skippable frames by their declared sizes, but only inside the bytes already peeked, and
matches the regular frame behind them. A walk never triggers a larger read, so a skippable
frame bigger than the window is a decline, not a new read.

A near match is final, with one exception. A bzip2 or xz header can be the first block of
a UDIF image, and the trailer step outranks those two hits (§2.4). Everything else the
later steps could offer is weaker evidence than an exact magic at its specified offset.

The weak point is length: some magics are two bytes (gzip `1f 8b`, unix-compress `1f 9d`).
Two bytes at offset 0 are reported `CERTAIN`, and a file that is only those two bytes fails
at open with `TruncatedError`. §5 lists it.

### 2.2 The SFX scan

This step runs only when the first bytes carry a cue (`MZ`, ELF, a Mach-O header that
parses, or `#!`). It searches up to 2 MiB for a ZIP, 7z or RAR needle, and every hit must
pass that format's validator before it counts. The cue decides only whether to spend the
window. The validator decides whether a hit is real. A structurally confirmed executable (a
`STRONG` cue) with no hit also turns off the content probes. Without that, a probe could claim the stub
as a compressed stream and `open_archive` would return a fabricated `installer.uncompressed`
member. A known non-archive signature (§2.5) does not start the scan, whatever cue its
bytes raise. All of this is on [`prefixed-archives.md`](prefixed-archives.md) §2 to §5.

One cost rule settled here belongs on this page because it is a budget question. **A 7z hit
whose declared end falls short of the end of the source is kept only as a fallback, and the
scan goes on reading to the end of the window** for a later 7z that does end there. The
scan cannot stop at the short hit's own end: a decoy inside the stub ends before the real
payload starts, so that bound would open the decoy. A 7z SFX with data after the archive
(an Authenticode signature, for example) therefore reads the whole window to detect, the
same as a miss. The cost stays inside `max_scan_bytes`. A tighter bound for PE stubs, the
end of the stub's last section, is in [`IDEAS.md`](../IDEAS.md).

### 2.3 Far magic

ISO 9660's `CD001` sits at 32 769, outside the 4 KiB window. The step peeks the extended
window once, through the same workspace, so the first 4 KiB is not read twice. A source
whose known size is smaller than the window never pays for the peek.

It runs **before** the content probes because a bootable or hybrid ISO keeps boot code in
its first 32 KiB, and boot code is the kind of data a probe accepts. If the probes ran first,
such an image would open as a single fabricated member, although an exact magic was at a
known offset the whole time.

A consequence worth knowing: a source that matches nothing in the first 4 KiB and is at
least 32 774 bytes long pays the far peek, whatever it turns out to be. A 40 000-byte file of
zeros named `backup.gz` reads 32 774 bytes before the extension guess.

### 2.4 Trailer magic

UDIF (a `.dmg`) keeps a 512-byte `koly` block at the end of the file, or at offset 0 on
an old image. The block starts with `koly`, version 4, and a header size of 512, all
big-endian: the same 12 bytes 7-Zip checks. Offset 0 is ordinary near magic. The block
at the end is this step.

It runs after far magic, so an ISO that already matched is not asked for a tail read.
An uncompressed image of an ISO 9660 disk is that case: `CD001` at 32 769 wins, and
the file is read as an ISO. It runs before the content probes, so a zlib-first image
is named as the image. What a compressed block contains, and why that is not a
signature detection can use, is on [`formats/dmg.md`](../formats/dmg.md) §1. The read is
one seek to the last 512 bytes on a path or a plain seekable stream, then a seek back to
the end of the prefix. A pipe and an `ArchiveStream` are not seeked to the end. When
the length is unknown the far-magic step has already read its window, so an image
that fits in that window is refused: the block is in the prefix. A longer zlib-first
image still opens as zlib. A source shorter than 512 bytes skips the read too.

A hit is `DMG` / `CERTAIN` / `magic`. Nothing reads the image. `open_archive` raises
`UnsupportedFeatureError` naming UDIF. `format_availability` reports `NONE` with an
empty `missing`: there is nothing to install. The `.dmg` suffix is not registered, so a
zip with that name stays a zip.

The step is not a ZIP tail probe. It looks at one fixed block for one signature, and a
ZIP appended to a JPEG is still not found (§5).

### 2.5 Content probes

The probes run in registry order (LZMA Alone, zlib, Brotli), and the first to accept wins.
Five guards keep a probe from claiming bytes that are not its format. The codec side of each
guard is on [`formats/single-file.md`](../formats/single-file.md) §2.1.

- **The probe decodes the whole 4 KiB window.** A shorter sample lets ordinary text pass:
  with a 256-byte sample, 7 of the first 800 Perl modules under `/usr/share/perl` decoded as
  a Brotli meta-block. With the whole window, none did.
- **A hit on a small source is re-checked against all of it.** When the source is longer
  than the window but no larger than `completion_window_bytes` (64 KiB under `BALANCED`),
  the whole source is peeked and the probe runs again. Its completeness check then rejects a
  decode that still asks for input at the end of the source. The window alone cannot tell a
  stream that goes on from one that turns invalid after 4 KiB.
- **A `STRONG` executable cue turns the step off** (§2.2).
- **A known non-archive signature turns the step off.** Today that is the OLE compound file
  signature `D0 CF 11 E0 A1 B1 1A E1` (`.doc`, `.xls`, `.ppt`, `.msi`, `Thumbs.db`). These
  files are a constant header followed by zero runs, which the Brotli and LZMA Alone probes
  both accept. A scan of a backup drive found 437 files claimed as Brotli, all but two of
  which failed to decode. OLE files were among them, but they were not counted separately,
  and the scan did not record what the two that decoded were. Neither probe's own framing
  can reject these files, and the spec forbids a threshold. An eight-byte signature is as
  specific as archive magic. The signature also turns off the SFX scan (§2.2): an OLE file
  is not a stub, and a ZIP stored inside a document is not the document's payload. With no
  extension, the error names the signature, as it names a `STRONG` cue.
- **Framing that the source cannot hold is rejected** when the source length is known.
  This check is the Brotli probe's own, on [`formats/brotli.md`](../formats/brotli.md).

The guards reduce false claims. They do not remove them: some structured binary files
(COFF objects, MP3s whose ID3 tag starts with padding) still pass a probe. What bounds
the damage is provenance. A probe hit with nothing to corroborate it is stamped, and when
a read fails, the error has
`format_unconfirmed=True` and emits `PROBE_FORMAT_UNCONFIRMED`. The open is not refused on
that basis, because a real extensionless stream that the probe identified correctly must
still be readable. Status is in threat-model O10.

**Corroboration** is either a matching extension or an inner-TAR upgrade. The upgrade
counts because reaching it took two independent things: the decode produced output, and
the output had `ustar` where TAR puts it.

### 2.6 Extension

When every content step declined, the longest matching suffix decides (`.tar.gz` beats
`.gz`), as `GUESS` / `extension`. That is the same situation in which content detection
refuses a file, so the bytes did not confirm the choice. Two things follow from that:

- A read that fails on an extension-only format sets `format_unconfirmed=True`, names the
  extension in its message, and emits `EXTENSION_FORMAT_UNCONFIRMED`. Without the stamp, a
  zero-filled `backup.gz` would fail as an ordinary corrupt gzip, which tells the caller the
  wrong thing about the file.
- A listing that completes with zero members also emits `EXTENSION_FORMAT_UNCONFIRMED`. 32
  KiB of zeros named `z.tar` opens as an empty TAR, and without that diagnostic nothing
  would say that the bytes never confirmed it. The open is not refused, because an empty tar
  is byte-for-byte the same file.

When no step matches, `FormatDetectionError` says so. A source with no bytes left at its
current position gets a different message, saying it is empty or already at its end. The
general message would tell the caller that some magic byte was wrong.

### 2.7 Special sources

- **A directory** is `DIRECTORY` / `CERTAIN` / `directory`, decided without reading
  anything, with the zero receipt. `detect_format` and `open_archive` give the same answer
  from `directory_format_info()`, so the two cannot disagree about a directory.
- **A stub-only `.exe` or `.sfx`** (no archive inside) next to a 7-Zip split first volume
  is detected as that volume. `detect_format` follows the stub by default
  (`follow_stub_volumes=True`), so `detect_format("vol.exe")` agrees with `open_archive`.
  `open_archive` probes with the flag off and then replaces the source itself, because it
  must hand the backend the volume's bytes and not the stub's. The receipt covers both
  passes (§4.1).

## 3. What the answer claims

### 3.1 Ties

**The earlier step wins; within a step, the earlier backend in registry order wins.** A
polyglot, one file that is valid as two formats, gets one deterministic answer. A caller who
wants the other reading passes `format=`. This is the documented rule, not an accident of
iteration (`docs/formats.md` §Detection).

A tie error (`AmbiguousFormatError`) would make a file that opens today fail, and the case
it serves is rare: a sweep of 33 947 real files found no file that two probes accepted, and
the only example of it (an executable holding both an end-anchored ZIP and a CRC-valid 7z)
is a hand-built file. `format=` already lets a caller choose.

### 3.2 `confidence`, `detected_by` and `corroborated`

- **`confidence` grades the evidence and does nothing else.** No error behaviour keys on
  it. `format_unconfirmed` asks whether anything corroborated the choice, which is a
  different question. When the two are tied together, a confidence value gets chosen to
  steer an exception and stops reporting confidence. LZMA Alone reports `PROBABLE`
  unconditionally, so a stamp keyed on `GUESS` would miss every fabricated LZMA Alone
  claim.
- **`confidence` is provisional in 0.2.x.** The grades are coarse: two bytes of gzip magic
  are `CERTAIN`. Calling the grade provisional lets a later release grade more finely
  without breaking a caller, which is why callers are told to branch on `format`.
- **`detected_by` is an open set.** A later step may add a value, so code that matches on
  it must handle an unknown one. `sfx_scan` covers every archive found behind a prefix,
  including a `#!` launcher, not only an executable stub.
- **`corroborated` is informational and provisional.** Its `False` means both "not
  corroborated" and "not a probe hit at all", so read it only together with
  `detected_by == "content_probe"`.

### 3.3 Conflicts

When the bytes and the extension disagree, the bytes win and `FORMAT_EXTENSION_CONFLICT`
is emitted, naming the evidence that won (magic, the stub scan, or content inspection). The
diagnostic lands on `FormatInfo.diagnostics`, or on the reader's collector when
`open_archive` detected. A caller whose policy raises on it gets `DiagnosticRaisedError`
before any reader exists. A TAR-combination extension over a bare compressor (`foo.tar.gz`
reported as `GZ` because no `ustar` was found) is agreement, not a conflict, and is silent.

An explicit `format=` skips detection, so it never produces a conflict. The detection
inside `format=` stub checks and inside the empty-listing rescan runs under
`probe_config(config)`: the library default config with the caller's budget. Those
detections are internal, so their diagnostics must not reach the caller's `on_diagnostic`,
and a `strict()` policy must not raise inside them.

## 4. Cost and source kinds

### 4.1 The budget

`DetectionBudget` (`archivey.detection_cost`) bounds each kind of work, and three presets
name common settings:

| Field | `BALANCED` (default) | `FAST` | `THOROUGH` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `max_prefix_bytes` | 4 KiB | 4 KiB | 4 KiB |
| `max_far_bytes` | 32 774 | 32 774 | 32 774 |
| `max_scan_bytes` | 2 MiB | 256 KiB | 2 MiB |
| `max_decode_input` / `max_decode_output` | 1 MiB | 64 KiB | 1 MiB |
| `completion_window_bytes` | 64 KiB | off | 1 MiB |

**The budget is set in one place, `ArchiveyConfig.detection_budget`.** `detect_format`,
`open_archive` and `open_stream` read it from there. With a second way to set it, such as a
`budget=` argument on `detect_format`, the same file could be detected under two budgets
and give two answers depending on the entry point.

**Decode input is one allowance for the whole call.** The content probes, the Brotli chain
decode, the completion re-check and the inner-TAR probe all draw on it, and a step the rest cannot cover does not
run. A per-candidate cap cannot bound the total: with 2 MiB of back-to-back gzip headers,
decoding each to a 64 KiB cap is hundreds of times more work than the input. Threat-model
O11 has the measurement. No step decodes scan candidates today, so that case is not
reachable yet. A step that does, such as compressor needles for makeself installers, must
draw on the same allowance. Decode output is charged only by the inner-TAR probe. A content
probe's output is bounded by the codec's own drain.

**Steps size their reads from the budget fields.** Each step in `detection.py` computes
its own request from the budget (`min(SFX_MAX, max_scan_bytes)`, the far window, what is
left of the decode allowance), and `PrefixWorkspace` meters what they read. A limit held
as a module constant somewhere else shadows the field meant to bound it: a `FAST`
detection overruns its own preset, and nothing in the receipt says why.

**Probe reads at an offset are the one path with fixed caps.** A content probe can ask for
a few bytes deep in the source through `PrefixWorkspace.read_at`, which is how the Brotli
chain walk checks later meta-block headers. On a path or a plain seekable stream,
`read_at` seeks to the offset, reads, and seeks back, without growing the prefix. It is
charged to `unique_bytes_read`. It is bounded by the walk's `CHAIN_MAX_LINKS` (8 links of
24 bytes), not by a budget field. On a pipe, or on an `ArchiveStream` whose rewind would
re-decode, `read_at` grows the prefix instead, up to the smaller of `PROBE_READ_AT_MAX_OFFSET_NONSEEKABLE` (1
MiB) and the workspace's read ceiling (the largest of the prefix, far and scan limits).
Past that it returns nothing and records `content_probe_read_at` as `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`.

When the walk stops at a compressed block past the window, the Brotli probe reads and
decodes `[0, end)`, to 4 KiB past that block's header, through the same `read_at` (a seek
read takes the part the prefix already holds from the prefix). That decode is charged to
`max_decode_input` and runs only when `end` is within the read ceiling and 1 MiB;
otherwise `content_probe_decode` is recorded as `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` and the probe keeps its
verdict.

**The receipt says what was spent and what did not run.** `FormatInfo.cost_receipt` counts
unique bytes read, far and scanned bytes, decode input and output, and passes.
`FormatInfo.unavailable_tiers` lists each step that did not run, as a `TierSkip` with one of
three reasons:

- `NOT_ENABLED_BY_POLICY`: the budget turned it off (`probe_completion` under `FAST`).
  The search is still complete for what the policy asked.
- `CAPABILITY_UNAVAILABLE`: the source cannot do it. The search is incomplete.
- `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`: it started or would have started, and the budget cut it short. The
  search is incomplete.

The distinction matters to a caller deciding whether a miss means "not an archive" or "not
found within what I allowed". The invariant a test holds: a receipt over its budget always
names a step as cut short. The check lives in `tests/detection_cost_util.py`; the library
never asks it.

When `detect_format` follows a stub to its volume, one receipt sums both passes and
`passes` is 2. The stub's pass is usually the expensive one, a full SFX scan. A receipt
from the second pass alone would hide most of the cost.

The receipt is separate from `ArchiveInfo.cost`, and the two are never summed. Detection
runs before the reader, and a caller comparing sources wants each number on its own.

### 4.2 One forward pass

Every step that reads the front of the source does so through one `PrefixWorkspace`
that only grows. Extending the window reads only the new prefix bytes, so near magic,
then a 2 MiB scan, then the far peek fetch each of those bytes once. Detection makes
one forward pass from the origin and does not seek back to fetch bytes the buffer
already holds. That rule is stated flatly and not derived from a cost model, because
`StreamCapability` cannot tell a cheap seek from an expensive one. A network range
reader or a member stream inside a solid 7z block would pay heavily for a rewind.

The trailer read is not part of that buffer. It seeks to the last 512 bytes and seeks
back to the end of the prefix, and it does not keep the bytes. When a later tier grows
the prefix over that range, it fetches them again, and `unique_bytes_read` counts the
512 twice. A seekable bzip2 or xz file larger than the prefix does this: the
near-magic hit is in the trailer's `preempts` list, so the tail is read before the
inner-TAR probe reads the file. A file that already fits in the prefix has the block
in the buffer, and there is no second fetch. Gzip, ZIP and ISO return before that
step, so they still fetch
each byte once. A `koly` hit returns at the trailer, before the probe, so those 512
bytes are fetched once.

A backward seek puts the handle back. It does not re-read the prefix:

- On exit, a seekable stream is seeked back to the caller's entry position. That is the
  non-consumption contract, and it happens once.
- `read_at` on a cheap-seek source seeks back to the end of the prefix after its probe
  read (§4.1), so the next forward fetch continues where the prefix ends. `read_at` never
  takes that path on an `ArchiveStream`, where a rewind would re-decode.
- The UDIF trailer read seeks back to the end of the prefix after its 512-byte read
  (§2.4). On a source that reached the step, that is a second backward seek, ahead of
  the exit restore. A pipe and an `ArchiveStream` are not asked.

### 4.3 Source kinds

| Source | What detection does | What it cannot do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Path | Opens its own handle for detection | Nothing missing |
| Seekable stream | Reads forward from the caller's position, restores it; the archive is taken to start where the caller positioned it | Nothing missing |
| Non-seekable, through `open_archive` / `open_stream` | Peeks through the `ArchiveSource` replay prefix; the backend reads the same object and drains the prefix first | No tail, including the `koly` block. Length is unknown unless the source ends inside the peek, so the probes' length-based checks do not run |
| Non-seekable, raw, to `detect_format` | Reads what it peeks | The caller loses those bytes unless it buffers the stream itself |
| Directory | Nothing | Nothing to do |

Detection never spools a pipe to a temporary file. The one temporary copy the library makes
is RAR's, for `unrar`, bounded by `SpoolLimits` and made after detection.

## 5. Sharp edges

**format**: inherent. **library**: upstream's. **archivey**: ours.

| What you see | Where | More |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A two-byte file `1f 8b` detects as `GZ` / `CERTAIN`, then fails at open with `TruncatedError` | **archivey** | Magic hits are not graded by length (§2.1, §3.2). The open still fails loudly |
| A ZIP appended to a JPEG, or behind any prefix that raises no cue, is not detected | **archivey** | The one tail read is the 512-byte `koly` block (§2.4), not a ZIP trailer. `format=ZIP` reads it. [`prefixed-archives.md`](prefixed-archives.md) §6 |
| An uncompressed `.dmg` whose disk is ISO 9660 opens as `ISO` | **archivey** | Far magic runs before the trailer (§2.4). [`formats/dmg.md`](../formats/dmg.md) §2.1 |
| Some binary files (COFF, ID3-tagged MP3) detect as LZMA Alone or Brotli and list one `.uncompressed` member | **format** | Three formats have no usable magic (§1). A failed read is stamped `format_unconfirmed` (§2.5). Threat-model O10 |
| A zero-filled `backup.gz` detects as `GZ` / `GUESS`; the read raises `CorruptionError` with `format_unconfirmed=True` | **format** | Extension was the only evidence (§2.6) |
| A v7 tar inside gzip, named `.tar.gz`, opens as bare `GZ` | **format** | No `ustar`, so no inner-TAR upgrade. [`formats/tar.md`](../formats/tar.md) §2.1 |
| A 7z SFX with data after the archive reads the whole 2 MiB window to detect | **archivey** | By choice (§2.2) |
| A source of 32 774 bytes or more that matches nothing near pays the far peek | **archivey** | The price of running far magic before the probes (§2.3) |
| `detect_format` on a raw pipe leaves the caller without the bytes it read | **archivey** | By design: `open_archive` and `open_stream` keep them (§4.3) |
| A polyglot opens as whichever format comes first | **archivey** | The tie rule (§3.1); pass `format=` |

## 6. Decisions

| Choice | Why | Rejected |

| A fixed sequence of six steps, first match wins | Every defect that motivated a scheduler had a fix of a few lines in the existing order. What a scheduler adds beyond that (graded evidence classes, a stopping proof, a per-candidate evidence record) had no measured demand, and it would regrade confidence and add a new failure on files that open today | An evidence ledger: graded evidence classes per candidate, a branch-and-bound scheduler, and `AmbiguousFormatError` on ties. The OpenSpec change is archived as decided against |
| Ties go to the earlier step, then registry order | A deterministic answer, and `format=` for the other reading. An ambiguity error would fail files that open today, for a case not seen in a 33 947-file sweep | `AmbiguousFormatError` |
| Exact magic, then SFX scan, then far magic, then the `koly` trailer, then probes | Strongest evidence first. Far magic goes ahead of the probes because a bootable ISO's system area is the kind of data a probe accepts. The trailer goes ahead of the probes for the same reason a zlib-first disk image must not open as its first block | Probes before far magic; a general ZIP tail scan |
| Probes decode the full 4 KiB window | A shorter sample lets text through (7 of 800 Perl modules with 256 bytes) | A 256-byte sample |
| A probe hit on a source up to 64 KiB is re-checked whole | The window cannot tell a stream that goes on from one that turns invalid after it | Accepting every hit on the window; an evidence class system for "stored-only" decodes |
| One decode-input allowance per call | A per-candidate cap cannot bound the total (O11) | Per-candidate caps |
| The budget lives on `ArchiveyConfig`, and `detect_format` has no `budget=` | One place to set it, so the entry points cannot detect one file under two budgets. The argument had never shipped in a release, so removing it cost no caller anything | A deprecated `budget=` kept alongside the config field |
| `confidence` grades evidence only; `format_unconfirmed` keys on corroboration | A grade chosen to steer an exception stops being a grade (§3.2) | Stamping on `GUESS` |
| Extension-only read failures are stamped too | A filename is weaker evidence than a probe, so it gets at least the same warning | Stamping probe hits only |
| `confidence` provisional, `detected_by` an open set | Lets a later release grade more finely or add a step without breaking callers | Freezing the grades and values in 0.2.0; renaming `sfx_scan` to `prefixed_scan` |
| A short 7z hit keeps the scan going to the end of the window | The short hit's own end would stop before a real payload that follows a decoy | Stopping at the first hit; bounding at the PE overlay now (an idea in [`IDEAS.md`](../IDEAS.md)) |
| The reader keeps the `FormatInfo` its open detected (`reader.format_info`) | `archivey info` prints it instead of detecting a second time, and a second detection could differ from the first | Detecting again in the CLI |
| Internal detections run under `probe_config(config)` | They spend what the caller allowed, but their diagnostics are not the caller's | Passing the caller's config through |

## 7. Open questions

- **Is one decode allowance enough once a step decodes scan candidates?** It would change
  whether makeself support needs its own cap. A measurement on a window packed with
  compressor needles, run with that step in place, would answer it. Threat-model O11 stays
  open until then.
- **What does a wasted tail read cost on a cold cache or over a network?** It decides
  whether the ZIP tail probe can ever be on by default.
  [`prefixed-archives.md`](prefixed-archives.md) §3 has the argument.
- **Should short magics be graded below `CERTAIN`?** It would change a label and nothing
  else, since no behaviour keys on `confidence`. A caller who asks to branch on confidence
  would be the reason to settle it.

| The detection receipt is not merged into the reader's cost (§4.1) | `::test_detection_receipt_is_not_merged_into_archive_cost` |
| One forward pass over the prefix. Gzip, ZIP and ISO fetch each byte once and seek backward only to restore the handle. A seekable bzip2 or xz file also reads the 512-byte trailer, then fetches those bytes again when a later tier reads the file (§4.2) | `tests/test_detection_workspace.py::test_seekable_detection_has_zero_backward_seeks`, `::test_seekable_bzip2_rereads_the_trailer_bytes`, `::test_seekable_koly_image_reads_the_trailer_once`, `::test_growing_prefix_fetches_each_byte_once`, `::test_seekable_stream_restored_on_error_path`, `tests/test_udif.py::test_detection_restores_the_stream_position` |

| Detection leaves a non-seekable stream readable by the backend (§4.3) | `tests/test_detection.py::test_peekable_stream_not_consumed` |
| A directory is decided without reading, with the zero receipt (§2.7) | `::test_detect_format_reports_directory_for_a_directory_path`, `::test_detect_format_directory_carries_a_zero_receipt` |
| A short 7z hit costs up to the scan window (§2.2) | `tests/test_sfx.py::test_short_7z_hit_scan_cost_is_bounded_by_the_window` |
| `archivey info` reads the open's detection instead of detecting again (§6) | `tests/test_cli.py::test_info_detects_once` |

To see what a detection spent, print `info.cost_receipt` and `info.unavailable_tiers` from
`detect_format(path, config=ArchiveyConfig(detection_budget=FAST_BUDGET))`.
