# Archive writing: the deferred design

**Status: not current truth.** Nothing here is implemented. There is no
`archivey.create`, no `ArchiveWriter`, and no writer module in `src/`.

This is the `archive-writing` capability spec as it stood before
`2026-09-02-retire-archive-writing-specs` removed it, plus the two per-format write
requirements that went with it. It was written as a contract for work that never
started, so it sat in `openspec/specs/` claiming a shipped surface — the same defect as
`format-zip`'s streaming-write requirement, at capability scale.

It is kept because the analysis is real and would otherwise be redone from scratch:
the `CompressionSpec` resolution matrix, the `add_members` conversion semantics, and the
`add_file` naming argument are all decisions someone reached once. Treat it as a
starting point for the writing phase's own exploration, not as a design to implement.
`PLAN.md` phase 9 owns the work; §Before re-specifying below is its entry gate.

## The writer surface as specified

```python
archivey.create(
    dest: str | Path | BinaryIO,
    format: ArchiveFormat,
    *,
    compression: CompressionSpec | None = None,
    password: str | bytes | None = None,
    encoding: str = "utf-8",
) -> ArchiveWriter
```

`format` was required — no inference from the destination name. `compression` set a
writer default that per-entry values override. `password` enabled encryption where the
target format supports it. `encoding` covered legacy non-Unicode path fields.
`ArchiveWriter` was a context manager finalizing on exit (ZIP writes its central
directory there).

Four ways to add an entry, deliberately named apart:

```python
def add_file(self, source: str | Path, *, name: str | None = None,
             recursive: bool = True, compression: CompressionSpec | None = None) -> None
def add_bytes(self, data: bytes | bytearray, name: str, *, modified: datetime | None = None,
              mode: int | None = None, compression: CompressionSpec | None = None) -> None
def add_stream(self, stream: BinaryIO, name: str, *, size: int | None = None,
               modified: datetime | None = None, mode: int | None = None,
               compression: CompressionSpec | None = None) -> None
def add_member(self, member: ArchiveMember, data: BinaryIO) -> None
```

`add_file` was named that way on purpose: a bare `add()` taking a path is ambiguous
against `add_bytes` / `add_stream` / `add_member`, and the ambiguity is worst in the
case that matters (a `str` that could be a path or content). With `recursive=True` a
directory source adds its whole tree; `name` overrides the archive-internal path.
`add_stream` streams without materializing the source, and `size` is optional but may be
required by formats that must write a size before the data. `add_member` copies the
member's representable metadata and reads bytes from `data`.

## Streaming conversion

```python
def add_members(self, source: ArchiveReader | Iterable[tuple[ArchiveMember, BinaryIO | None]],
                *, filter: MemberFilter | None = None) -> None
```

The point of the design. It accepts a reader directly or the pair iterable
`stream_members()` already yields, so converting an archive never requires materializing
a member list and handing it back to the writer.

The division of labour was explicit: **reader-side selection** happens through
`stream_members(members=...)`, **writer-side transformation** through `filter`, the same
`Callable[[ArchiveMember], ArchiveMember | None]` extraction uses. Returning `None`
skips the member.

The subtle rule, and the one most likely to be got wrong on a reimplementation: the
filter applies to a transient `.replace()` copy used for the written entry's identity,
while the original mutable member and its stream continue through the backend. That is
what keeps late-bound field updates (sizes and CRC arriving after the data) visible to
the caller — see [`formats/zip.md`](../formats/zip.md) §1 for why those fields are late
in the first place.

The rest of the conversion contract: consume sources sequentially; drive a reader
through `stream_members()` internally; respect solid-archive bounded-memory semantics;
pipe member data in chunks with a 1 MiB default; translate metadata directly; skip
member types the target format cannot represent with a `logging.WARNING` rather than an
exception; never buffer the whole archive. Per-member format-internal buffering was
allowed where the format forces it — a ZIP local header needing the CRC before the data
is the named case.

## The `CompressionSpec` model

```python
class CompressionLevel(Enum):
    STORE = "store"
    FAST = "fast"
    DEFAULT = "default"
    MAX = "max"

@dataclass
class CompressionSpec:
    algo: CompressionAlgorithm | None = None      # None = backend auto-selects
    level: int | CompressionLevel = CompressionLevel.DEFAULT

CompressionSpec.STORED       = CompressionSpec(algo=CompressionAlgorithm.STORED)
CompressionSpec.DEFLATE      = CompressionSpec(algo=CompressionAlgorithm.DEFLATE, level=6)
CompressionSpec.DEFLATE_MAX  = CompressionSpec(algo=CompressionAlgorithm.DEFLATE,
                                               level=CompressionLevel.MAX)
CompressionSpec.LZMA         = CompressionSpec(algo=CompressionAlgorithm.LZMA2,
                                               level=CompressionLevel.DEFAULT)
```

`algo` reuses `CompressionAlgorithm` from the read-side data model rather than minting a
writer enum. `level` is either numeric or a format-agnostic symbolic level, because a
caller who wants "as small as possible" should not have to know that ZIP's maximum is 9
and LZMA's is different.

Resolution:

| `algo` | `level` | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `None` | `STORE` / `FAST` / `DEFAULT` / `MAX` | Backend picks a format-appropriate available algorithm for that effort; `STORE` selects `STORED` |
| `None` | numeric | Format default algorithm at that level, or the algorithm the level implies |
| set | `STORE` | Resolves to `STORED`, with a `logging.WARNING` for the contradiction |
| set | `FAST` / `DEFAULT` / `MAX` | That algorithm, symbolic level mapped to the nearest concrete one |
| set | numeric | That algorithm at that level; out of range raises `ValueError` and is **not** clamped |

`compression=None` anywhere equals `CompressionSpec(algo=None, level=DEFAULT)`.

**No silent substitution.** An explicit `algo` whose backend is missing, or that the
target format cannot represent, fails fast at `create()` or at the first `add_*` that
would use it — `PackageNotInstalledError` or `UnsupportedFeatureError`. Degrading to the
format default would write an archive the caller did not ask for. With `algo=None` the
backend chooses, because then the caller expressed no preference to violate.

## The per-format write requirements that went with it

**ZIP — streaming write via data descriptors.** Set general-purpose flag `0x8`, write
placeholder CRC and sizes in the local file header, stream the data, then append the
real CRC-32 and both sizes after it. The size need not be known in advance, which is
what makes a non-seekable destination possible. Removed in
`2026-09-02-drop-unshipped-write-claims`; the read-path half of the same format fact is
on [`formats/zip.md`](../formats/zip.md) §1.

**TAR — streaming write.** "The backend SHALL support writing TAR archives, including
streaming writes", with the scenario "member data is written in archive order without
requiring a seekable destination". TAR needs no trailer fixup, so this is nearly free
for the format.

**Testing — round trip per writable format.** `create → extract → compare` for every
writable format, matching content and metadata within the format's documented timestamp
and permission limits, with ZIP and TAR rows and a rule that a new writable format adds
its row before being considered supported. Worth reinstating verbatim when there is a
writer to test.

## Never resolved

Two questions the spec left open, recorded in `PLAN.md` phase 9:

- **Per-entry `compression` on stream-compressed containers.** For `tar.gz` / `tar.zst`
  the codec is a property of the outer stream, so a per-entry algorithm is meaningless.
  Error or warn-and-ignore? The leaning was `ValueError` on an explicit per-entry algo,
  with the writer-level `CompressionSpec` selecting the outer codec.
- **`password=` on a format whose writer cannot encrypt.** Stdlib `zipfile` cannot write
  encryption at all, so this must fail at `create()` rather than at the first member. The
  open part is the error type (`UnsupportedFeatureError` vs `UnsupportedOperationError`)
  and whether a `SUPPORTS_PASSWORD`-style field on the write backend should enforce it
  centrally, mirroring the read side.

## Before re-specifying

`PLAN.md` phase 9 makes two explorations an entry gate, both because they shape the API
and are expensive to retrofit:

- **Reproducible output** — `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, stable member ordering, normalized
  metadata. `IDEAS.md` calls this the build-tool adoption wedge.
- **The metadata-fidelity boundary** — xattrs, ACLs, resource forks. Read-side promotion
  is additive and can wait; write-side fidelity has to be a day-one decision because it
  shapes `add_member` and the round-trip contract. Threat model C3.

Neither is addressed anywhere above, which is the strongest argument for treating this
document as a starting point rather than a plan.
