# format-rar — materialization becomes bounded and reported

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Serve random access and extraction with bounded explicit temp use

The system SHALL serve non-solid random reads by invoking `unrar` for the target
member **with that member's path as the sole path argument**, doing
O(member_size) data work. For solid random reads, the system SHALL decode from
archive start to the target member (named `unrar p … <member>`). Each such read
is its own decode: the reader SHALL NOT amortize repeated solid reads by
extracting members into a temporary directory and serving later reads from disk.
`extract_all()` SHALL be served by the same `stream_members()` pass as any other
caller, plus a second `stream_members()` pass when a selected hardlink's source
was excluded and has to be re-read; on a solid archive each pass is one unnamed
`unrar p` addressed at the whole archive, decoding only as far as the last
member it needs. Which members a pass names on the `unrar` command line — and
which need no spawn at all — is governed by `Constrain unrar argv by call site`.
Any temp materialization SHALL be a declared RAR strategy, not an implicit
in-memory buffer; the only one the reader implements is copying a non-path
archive *source* to disk so `unrar` can seek it, the deferred small-member
optimization being the other strategy this capability declares.

A non-path stream source SHALL NOT be copied to disk at open. Both stream shapes —
a single stream and an ordered set of stream volumes — SHALL defer the copy to the
first member read that `unrar` has to serve, and a caller that only lists SHALL
write nothing. An `open()` the reader refuses before spawning `unrar` — a name it
cannot address through an include mask, or one whose mask would pull in earlier
members — is not such a read and SHALL write nothing either. Listing SHALL be served from the source the caller supplied; for a
volume set the reader SHALL read each volume as its own bounded view over that
source rather than reopening or copying it.

When the copy does happen for a volume set it SHALL write the whole set, because
`unrar` resolves sibling volumes by name.

**Materializing the archive source is subject to the configured spool limit**
(`access-mode-and-cost`) and SHALL NOT be exempt from it on the grounds that the
source was already seekable: the bytes, the directory and the cost are the same
either way. A source larger than the limit SHALL raise
`SpoolLimitExceededError` before any bytes are written, since the archive size is
known. With the limit set to none, a member that cannot be read directly SHALL be
refused rather than materialized. Multi-volume stream sources SHALL be measured
**across the whole volume set**, not per volume.

When the archive is opened from a
non-path stream source, `ar.cost.notes` SHALL include a human-readable disk-copy
caveat **at open** (path sources SHALL NOT): a single stream source SHALL warn
that reading a compressed member will copy the whole archive to disk; ordered
stream volumes SHALL warn that reading a compressed member will copy every volume
to a temp directory. The caveat SHALL name the limit that bounds the copy, so a
caller reads the worst case rather than only the fact of it. The note is a
static open-time caveat, not an occurrence log:
it SHALL be present even if only stored members are read, and SHALL NOT appear
after materialization if it was absent at open. Mixed-password
nonsolid archives MUST NOT demultiplex one unnamed `unrar p` ALL pipe against the
full member list (wrong-password members are omitted from stdout and would
desynchronize sizes).

#### Scenario: random/extract matrix

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Random `open()` in non-solid RAR | `unrar p … <archive> <member>`; work is O(member_size) |
| Stream source, archive within the spool limit | One materialization; the open-time caveat already named the bound |
| Stream source, archive over the spool limit | `SpoolLimitExceededError` before any bytes are written |
| Stream source, spool limit set to none, compressed member | Refused; nothing is written |
| Stream source, second compressed member after the first | No second spool; materialization is once per reader |
| Multi-volume stream source | One spool set; the limit applies to the total across volumes |
| Repeated random opens in solid RAR | Each open is its own `unrar p` decode from archive start; no tempdir cache, and the re-decode is reported as `RewindWarning.min_redecode_bytes` |
| `extract_all()` | The same `stream_members()` pass as any other caller, plus a second pass when a selected hardlink's source was excluded and must be re-read; no `unrar x` |
| Mixed-password nonsolid stream/open | Per-member named `unrar` (or equivalent); no ALL-pipe demux |
| Single non-path stream, at open | `ar.cost.notes` warns a compressed read will copy to disk, naming the limit that bounds it; nothing is written yet |
| Ordered stream volumes, at open | `ar.cost.notes` warns a compressed read will copy every volume, naming the limit that bounds it; nothing is written yet |
| Ordered stream volumes, listing only | No temp directory is created |
| Solid `stream_members()` pass, no member read | Nothing is written, even from a stream source |
| Ordered stream volumes, first compressed read | The whole set is written once; later reads reuse it; close removes it |
| Stream source, `open()` refused before any spawn | Nothing is written; the refusal raises without materializing |
| Path source | `ar.cost.notes` has no disk-copy caveat |
