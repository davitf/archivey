## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Magic-first detection with extension fallback and confidence scoring

The system SHALL execute format detection with this algorithm:

1. Read up to `DETECTION_LIMIT` bytes (default 4096) from the source.
2. **Near magic** — the magic-byte table at exact offsets within that window. Match →
   `CERTAIN` / `detected_by="magic"`.
3. **Prefixed payload** — the tiers owned by *Self-extracting (SFX) archives are detected
   behind an executable stub*.
4. **Far magic** — signatures whose end offset lies outside the default window, today ISO
   9660's `CD001` at 32 769. Match → `CERTAIN` / `detected_by="magic"`. This SHALL be
   attempted **before** the content probes: it is exact magic at a known offset and they
   are the weakest signal available. It SHALL be skipped when the source size is known to
   be smaller than the extended window, and a source too short for it SHALL fall through
   rather than be rejected.
5. **Content probes** — formats with no exact magic. Match → `detected_by="content_probe"`.
6. **Extension** — `Path` with a known extension → `GUESS` / `detected_by="extension"`.
7. `FormatDetectionError` when nothing matched.

Steps are ordered attempts, not alternatives: a step that produces no match falls through,
and attempting one never prevents a later one from running.

#### Scenario: unrecognised bytes, no path

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Non-seekable `BinaryIO`, no filename, no magic | `FormatDetectionError` |

#### Scenario: far magic precedes the content probes

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Bootable/hybrid ISO whose 32 KiB system area holds boot code a probe accepts | `ISO` / `CERTAIN` / `magic` — not a fabricated single-file member |
| ISO with a zeroed system area | `ISO` / `CERTAIN` / `magic`; unchanged |
| Source smaller than the extended window, size known | Step 4 skipped without an extended peek; falls through |
| Source too short for the window, size unknown | Short peek, no match, falls through — never an error for being short |
| Real Brotli stream larger than the window, no extension | One bounded peek misses at step 4, then step 5 detects it |

### Requirement: Magic-byte table

Exact matches only (no fuzzy/weak magic). Recognised:

| Format | Signature (summary) |
| --- | --- |
| ZIP | `50 4B 03 04` / `07 08` / `05 06` |
| GZip | `1F 8B` |
| BZip2 | `42 5A 68` |
| XZ | `FD 37 7A 58 5A 00` |
| Zstandard | `28 B5 2F FD`, optionally preceded by skippable frames |
| 7-Zip | `37 7A BC AF 27 1C` |
| RAR 4.x / 5.x | `52 61 72 21 1A 07 00` / `… 01 00` |
| ISO 9660 | `CD001` at 32769 |
| TAR | `ustar` at 257 |
| LZ4 | `04 22 4D 18` |
| lzip | `LZIP` |
| unix-compress | `1F 9D` |

Formats without reliable exact magic (notably **zlib**) SHALL NOT appear here —
content probe only.

A zstd **skippable frame** — magic in `0x184D2A50 .. 0x184D2A5F` followed by a
little-endian `uint32` payload size — carries no compressed data and MAY precede the first
regular frame. Detection SHALL walk consecutive skippable frames by their declared sizes
within the peeked prefix and match the regular frame that follows. A source of skippable
frames alone, or one whose declared size runs past the prefix, SHALL NOT be claimed as
zstd: the walk is arithmetic over already-peeked bytes and never extends the read.

#### Scenario: magic matrix

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Starts `50 4B 03 04` | ZIP, `CERTAIN`, `magic` |
| Magic table consulted for zlib | No zlib entry; CMF/FLG → zlib probe |
| `ustar` at 257, ≥512 bytes | TAR, `CERTAIN`, `magic` |

#### Scenario: zstd frame prefix

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Regular frame at offset 0 | `ZST`, `CERTAIN`, `magic` |
| One skippable frame, then a regular frame | `ZST`, `CERTAIN`, `magic` |
| Several chained skippable frames, then a regular frame | `ZST`, `CERTAIN`, `magic` |
| Skippable frames only, no regular frame | No zstd claim; falls through |
| Skippable frame whose declared size runs past the peeked prefix | No zstd claim; no extended read |

### Requirement: Magic-less formats are detected by a content probe

When the magic-byte table yields no match, the system SHALL run each registered
content probe on the peeked prefix (consumes nothing). This covers Brotli (no
signature), zlib (too-unspecific CMF/FLG), and LZMA Alone (13-byte header whose
properties byte is too weak for exact magic). Probes typically decode a bounded
prefix; MAY gate on cheap structural bytes first; and MAY consult the source length
when detection knows it (see the framing requirement below). Skip when the
decompressor backend is missing (fall through to extension). Extension MAY override
a disagreeing probe (false-positive risk on short/adversarial input).

A probe match SHALL report `detected_by="content_probe"`. For **Brotli specifically**,
confidence SHALL be `PROBABLE` when the file extension corroborates the format **or**
when the first meta-block is compressed, and `GUESS` when the only evidence is a
probe hit whose first meta-block is uncompressed or metadata. Brotli's probe is the
only one measured to accept ordinary files (3.5% of a real `/usr` tree before the
framing gate), and that false-positive mass concentrates in the uncompressed/metadata
first-block class — so those claims are weaker evidence than a compressed-first hit or
an extension-backed one. This does not change *what* is detected — only what the system
claims to know about it.

The zlib and LZMA Alone probes keep `PROBABLE` unconditionally. Both measured **0 false
positives in 20 000 random blobs**, so the confidence downgrade would cost honesty rather
than buy it. (Alone was additionally re-measured at 0 over 4 000 blobs of 64 KiB; its
real-world residual is a framing problem, not a confidence one — see the framing
requirement.)

Within Brotli, a probe-only hit whose **first meta-block is compressed** SHALL keep
`PROBABLE`: measured on random data, that class is accepted 0.014% of the time against
~100% for an uncompressed first block, and 25 of 25 real streams found in the wild are
compressed-first. An uncompressed or metadata first block is the class every false
positive comes from, and takes `GUESS`. This split grades evidence strength only —
`format_unconfirmed` / `PROBE_FORMAT_UNCONFIRMED` key on probe-only provenance, not on
confidence (see *Detection confidence SHALL NOT be the trigger for error provenance*).
Uncompressed-first remains a valid stream class (incompressible payloads); the framing
gate keeps those streams — they are not rejected for being uncompressed-first.

The **zlib** probe SHALL gate on the RFC 1950 header grammar — `CM == 8`, `CINFO <= 7`,
and `(CMF * 256 + FLG) % 31 == 0` — rather than an allow-list of common headers, and SHALL
accept a header with `FDICT` set. All seven legal window sizes are therefore recognised.
`FDICT` is accepted rather than rejected because a preset dictionary is valid zlib and the
decode, not the header, decides what archivey can read: today no dictionary is ever
supplied to the codec layer, so every `FDICT` stream fails that decode and falls through.
The gate does not encode that as a rejection — the day a dictionary can be supplied, the
grammar already admits the header.

The LZMA Alone probe SHALL attempt a bounded `FORMAT_ALONE` decode and MUST NOT
claim streams that already matched exact magic (notably lzip `LZIP` and xz
`FD 37 7A…`). It SHALL NOT reject a **dictionary size** of zero: every 32-bit value is
legal and decoders round values below 4 KiB up to 4 KiB. Rejecting zero was an ordering
workaround for a zero-filled ISO system area, which the far-magic step of the detection
algorithm now answers before any probe runs.

It SHALL, separately, refuse a header declaring an **uncompressed size** of exactly zero.
Any value but the all-ones "unknown" sentinel is the stream's exact output length, so zero
declares a stream carrying no payload — nothing that can be opened. This is the same rule
as the probe's existing refusal to claim an empty successful decode, stated at the header
because a bounded probe cannot reach it: 18 zero bytes are a *valid, complete, empty*
Alone stream (a legal 13-byte header plus a five-byte range-coder init), so zero-filled
padding decodes cleanly to nothing and the bounded read then reports truncation, which is
otherwise a match. This refuses nothing that was ever detected: an empty stream is not
claimed with or without the rule, because the probe already declines an empty decode, and
a `.lzma` name still opens one through the extension. The two header fields are
independent: a stream with a zero dictionary size and a real payload is still detected.

#### Scenario: content-probe matrix

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| No magic; bounded prefix decompresses as Brotli, name is `x.br` | `BROTLI`, `PROBABLE`, `content_probe` |
| No magic; bounded prefix decompresses as Brotli, first meta-block compressed, no corroborating extension | `BROTLI`, `PROBABLE`, `content_probe` |
| No magic; bounded prefix decompresses as Brotli, first meta-block uncompressed/metadata, no corroborating extension | `BROTLI`, `GUESS`, `content_probe` |
| zlib CMF/FLG + clean zlib decode | `ZLIB`, `PROBABLE`, `content_probe` — unchanged |
| zlib-looking header, decode fails | No zlib claim; fall through to extension / fail |
| `.br`, Brotli extra missing | Probe skipped; extension guess `BROTLI`/`GUESS` |
| No magic; bounded prefix decompresses as LZMA Alone | `LZMA_ALONE`, `PROBABLE`, `content_probe` — unchanged |
| Stream starts with `LZIP` | lzip magic wins; Alone probe not claimed |
| Alone-looking bytes that fail `FORMAT_ALONE` decode | No Alone claim; fall through |

#### Scenario: header grammars accept the full legal range

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| zlib stream at any window size 512 B – 32 KiB (`18 95`, `28 91`, `38 8d`, `48 89`, `58 85`, `68 81`, `78 9c`) | `ZLIB`, `content_probe` — all seven |
| zlib header with `FDICT` set | Header passes the grammar; the decode decides. Archivey supplies no preset dictionary today, so the decode fails and no zlib claim is made |
| Header failing `CM == 8`, `CINFO <= 7` or the mod-31 check (e.g. all-zero bytes) | No zlib claim; no decode attempted |
| LZMA Alone stream whose dictionary-size field is zero | `LZMA_ALONE`, `content_probe` |
| Alone header declaring an uncompressed size of exactly zero | No Alone claim; no payload to open |
| Zero-filled source of any length (padding, a sparse or zero-truncated file) | No Alone claim — the header declares zero output |
| Zero-filled source with `CD001` at 32 769 | `ISO` at the far-magic step; no Alone claim |
