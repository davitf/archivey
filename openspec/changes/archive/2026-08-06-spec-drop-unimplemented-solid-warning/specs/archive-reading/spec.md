## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Bounded-memory sequential streaming via stream_members

```python
def stream_members(
    self,
    members: MemberSelector | None = None,
) -> Iterator[tuple[ArchiveMember, ArchiveStream | None]]: ...
```

Yields `(member, stream)` in archive order with bounded memory. Solid blocks
decompress progressively (never buffered whole); peak = decoder working set + one
in-flight chunk. Non-file members yield `None`.

`members` is a selector (names/identities or predicate), not a transform. Streams
are lazy: unselected/unread members are not opened/decompressed and do not request
passwords. Yields the original mutable `ArchiveMember` so late-bound fields stay
visible.

Yielded streams are iterator-owned and valid only until advance: the iterator SHALL
close/invalidate the previous stream before the next yield. MUST NOT retain a
growing decompressed-block cache until reader close. On solid archives, random
`open()` may re-decode from block start; the cost is silent, and callers are
directed to `stream_members()` by `reader.cost.access_cost` and by the `open()` /
`read()` docstrings rather than by a runtime warning.

A `stream_members()` invocation is an exclusive one-pass/data-path operation in
both modes. It SHALL NOT overlap random `open()`, materialization, another
iteration/data pass, unrelated extraction, or reader close. An `extract_all()`
owner MAY invoke it as a child pass and MAY read/close the yielded child stream.
Unrelated overlap SHALL raise `ArchiveyUsageError` at the later op and leave the
active pass/stream valid. (Unlike random `open()`, whose independently owned
streams may coexist when `CONCURRENT` is declared — see `reader-concurrency`.)

#### Scenario: stream_members matrix

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Yielded file stream emits diagnostic before advance | Stream + reader snapshots share one retained occurrence |
| Selector excludes member / stream unread | No open/decompress; no data-path diagnostic |
| Solid archive | Progressive decode; peak = decompressor state + one chunk |
| `stream_members(lambda m: m.name.endswith(".txt"))` | Only `.txt`; unselected never opened; original mutable members |
| Fully read stream, then inspect member | Late-bound fields (e.g. size/CRC) visible on same object |
| Advance after one yield | Prior stream closed/invalidated first |
| Random `open()` during active pass | `ArchiveyUsageError`; pass remains usable |
| Close/abandon partial generator | Current stream closed; pass ownership released once |
| Random `open()` into solid block | Re-decode from block start + skip; no diagnostic, no warning — discoverable via `reader.cost.access_cost` and the `open()` docstring |
