## ADDED Requirements

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Declare RAR format properties

The RAR backend SHALL expose these properties:

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Read dependency (metadata) | None; native RAR 1.5–RAR5 header parser |
| Read dependency (data) | RARLAB `unrar` or `rar` binary on `PATH` (`unrar` preferred) |
| Listing cost | O(1); headers parsed natively, no member-data decompression |
| Access cost | `SOLID` for solid archives; `DIRECT` otherwise |
| Supports write | No |
| Requires seek | Yes |

#### Scenario: format property matrix

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Open non-header-encrypted RAR without `unrar`/`rar` | Listing and metadata still work through the native parser |
| Open from a non-seekable source | Open fails because RAR header parsing requires seek |
| Attempt to create/write RAR | `UnsupportedOperationError` |

### Requirement: Use RARLAB unrar only for member data that needs it

The system SHALL read stored, uncompressed, unencrypted members directly as raw
bytes through the shared pass-through backend. All other member data SHALL be
read by invoking a system RARLAB decompressor: `unrar` if a usable binary is on
`PATH`, otherwise `rar`. A usable binary is identified by a RARLAB banner
(`Alexander Roshal` or `RARLAB`, plus a standalone `UNRAR` or `RAR` token that
does not match inside `UNRAR`) whose parsed major.minor is 6.0 or later.
If a decompressor is required and missing or incompatible, the system SHALL raise
`PackageNotInstalledError` naming RARLAB `unrar` or `rar`. Archivey MUST NOT
silently use `unrar-free`, `unar`, `bsdtar`, `7z`, or a degraded backend. The
spawn SHALL be the `p` (print to stdout) command only.

#### Scenario: unrar dependency matrix

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Stored member, `unrar`/`rar` missing | Raw bytes are returned without invoking either |
| Compressed member, both missing | `PackageNotInstalledError` names `unrar` or `rar` |
| PATH `unrar` is not RARLAB `unrar`, and no usable `rar` | `PackageNotInstalledError` names RARLAB `unrar` or `rar` |
| RARLAB `unrar` older than 6.0 and no usable `rar`, or a RARLAB banner with no parseable version | `PackageNotInstalledError` names the floor and the version found; refused at identification |
| RARLAB `rar` 6.0+ on `PATH`, `unrar` missing | Used for compressed/encrypted member data; spawn is `rar p` |
| RARLAB `unrar` 6.0+ and RARLAB `rar` both on `PATH` | `unrar` is used |
| Listing only, both missing | No data dependency is checked |
