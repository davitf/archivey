## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Explicit configuration object

The system SHALL define these complete frozen schemas:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ExtractionLimits:
    max_extracted_bytes: int | None = 2 * 2**30
    max_ratio: float | None = 1000.0
    ratio_activation_threshold: int = 5 * 2**20
    max_entries: int | None = 1_048_576
    UNLIMITED: ClassVar["ExtractionLimits"]

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ListingLimits:
    max_members: int | None = 1_048_576
    max_metadata_bytes: int | None = 64 * 2**20
    UNLIMITED: ClassVar["ListingLimits"]

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class DecoderLimits:
    max_decoder_memory: int | None = 2 * 2**30
    max_key_derivation_rounds: int | None = 2**27
    UNLIMITED: ClassVar["DecoderLimits"]

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ArchiveyConfig:
    use_rapidgzip: AcceleratorMode = AcceleratorMode.AUTO
    use_indexed_bzip2: AcceleratorMode = AcceleratorMode.AUTO
    zip_unflagged_fallback_encoding: str = "cp437"
    rar_allow_glob_member_concatenation: bool = False
    read_link_targets: bool = True
    extraction_limits: ExtractionLimits = ExtractionLimits()
    listing_limits: ListingLimits = ListingLimits()
    decoder_limits: DecoderLimits = DecoderLimits()
    diagnostic_policy: DiagnosticPolicy = DiagnosticPolicy()
    max_retained_diagnostic_references: int = 256
    on_diagnostic: Callable[[Diagnostic], None] | None = None
```

`max_retained_diagnostic_references` SHALL be non-negative. Policy/default/override
mappings and the dataclasses SHALL be defensively immutable. `config=None` →
immutable library default. No mutable global/context-local diagnostic policy or
callback.

A reader carries its open config, all of it, for its lifetime. Reader methods
SHALL NOT take a `config=`: `extract_all(limits=...)` is the one per-call
override, and it replaces only the extraction limits for that call.
`decoder_limits` SHALL bound the working memory a codec allocates on the
strength of a number the archive declares, and SHALL be enforced before that
allocation is made. `max_key_derivation_rounds` SHALL bound the total
password-to-key hashing rounds one reader runs, counted as the archive declares
them (RAR5 `2**kdf_count` PBKDF2 rounds plus the `+16`/`+32` offsets, 7z
`2**NumCyclesPower`, RAR3 its fixed `2**18`), summed over the derivations that
actually run: a key the reader already derived for the same password, salt and
cost SHALL cost nothing, and every candidate password tried SHALL count. The
check SHALL run before the derivation that would cross the cap, and SHALL raise
`ResourceLimitError`, which SHALL NOT be treated as a wrong password by
candidate iteration. Per-call `limits`
still beat `config.extraction_limits`, then reader/library default. Other
per-call operational args stay outside `ArchiveyConfig`.
`read_link_targets` SHALL decide whether the reader reads, on its own, a symlink target
the format stores as member data (see "Link targets stored as member data are read only
when configured"); like `listing_limits`, it holds for the reader's lifetime.

`on_diagnostic` runs synchronously after count/retention/logging updates. Snapshot
reads from a callback are allowed. Starting another operation on the same
emitting reader/stream SHALL raise `UnsupportedOperationError`; other readers OK.
Callbacks hold no Archivey collector/reader/stream/backend/registry lock
(`diagnostics` / `reader-concurrency`).

#### Scenario: config matrix

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| `ArchiveyConfig()` | AUTO accelerators; documented extraction and listing defaults; COLLECT; budget 256; no callback |
| `extract(..., extraction_limits=ExtractionLimits(max_ratio=100))` | 100:1 per-member ratio enforced (`safe-extraction`) |
| Reader opened with `listing_limits=ListingLimits(max_members=10)` | Listing caps stay at 10 for the reader lifetime; `extract_all()` has no `config=` to change them |
| Reader opened with `read_link_targets=False` | No data-stored link target is read by listing or a pass for the reader lifetime |
| Header-encrypted RAR5 set of four parts, one encryption record repeated, `max_key_derivation_rounds` one round short of key + PswCheck | `ResourceLimitError` at `open_archive`; at exactly key + PswCheck the set lists |
| Password list `["wrong", right]`, budget covering only the right candidate's derivations | `ResourceLimitError`, not `EncryptionError`; the list does not continue |
