## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Decrypt RAR5 header-encrypted archives natively

The system SHALL decrypt RAR5 header-encrypted archives through the optional
crypto backend when a valid password is supplied. The native parser derives the
AES key and decrypts headers itself; `unrar` is not required for listing and
remains required only for member data. Header-encrypted listing without a
password SHALL raise `EncryptionError`; with a password but no `cryptography`
backend (`[recommended]`), it SHALL raise `PackageNotInstalledError`. Any encrypted RAR
SHALL set `ArchiveInfo.is_encrypted` to `True`.

#### Scenario: header encryption matrix

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Header-encrypted RAR5, no password | `EncryptionError` |
| Header-encrypted RAR5, password but no crypto backend | `PackageNotInstalledError` |
| Header-encrypted RAR5, valid password + crypto | Headers decrypt natively; members list; `is_encrypted` true |
| Read member data from that archive | `unrar` is still required |
